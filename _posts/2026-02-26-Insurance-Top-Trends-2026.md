# Part 1: English Summary

## Report Overview

- **Source**: Capgemini Research Institute for Financial Services — *Insurance Top Trends 2026*
- **Published**: January 2026
- **Scope**: Covers three segments of the insurance industry — **P&C (Property & Casualty)**, **Life**, and **Health** — across global markets including the Americas, Europe, and Asia-Pacific
- **Structure**: Three strategic pillars, ten trends in total
- **Purpose**: To help insurers understand which strategic, operational, and technological trends will define competitive advantage in 2026 and beyond

The central tension the report addresses: the insurance industry is sitting at a crossroads between **rising customer expectations** (personalization, digital-first experiences, wellness integration) and **structural constraints** (legacy systems, data fragmentation, regulatory complexity, climate volatility). The ten trends map a path from where the industry is to where it needs to be.

---

## The Three Pillars

| Pillar | Focus | Trends |
|---|---|---|
| **Distribution and Engagement** | How insurers attract, retain, and serve customers | Trends 1–4 |
| **Operational Efficiency** | How insurers optimize data, underwriting, claims, and cost management | Trends 5–8 |
| **Technological Innovation** | How insurers modernize infrastructure and scale AI | Trends 9–10 |

Each trend is rated for relevance across P&C, Life, and Health segments, allowing carriers to identify which developments are most applicable to their core business.

---

## Pillar 1: Distribution and Engagement

### Overview

The distribution and engagement pillar captures how the insurer-customer relationship is being fundamentally redefined. Three headline statistics frame the challenge:

- **71%** of P&C customers don't feel their insurer understands their personal needs
- **60%** of consumers are underinsured or have no life insurance coverage at all
- **74%** of young adults (ages 18–40) say they are more likely to purchase insurance from a company that offers wellness incentives

These numbers point to a massive opportunity — and a massive failure of the status quo. Insurers that were built around product-centric, one-size-fits-all distribution models are losing relevance with a customer base that expects personalized, digital, and value-driven experiences.

---

### Trend 1: Customer Centricity (P&C, Life, Health)

**Headline**: *"Hyper-personalization drives customer satisfaction and retention through tailored experiences and engagement."*

#### Background

Traditional insurers still largely treat customers as risk pools rather than individuals. Customer data — claims history, lifestyle signals, digital behavior, health records — sits in fragmented silos that prevent insurers from building a coherent, real-time picture of each customer's needs. As a result, most customer interactions feel generic, reactive, and impersonal.

The competitive pressure is rising from multiple directions: digital-native insurers (insurtechs), big tech companies entering the space, and customers who now expect the same level of personalization from their insurer that they receive from Netflix, Amazon, or their bank.

#### Key Data Points

- **60%** of customers cite personalized policy recommendations as a key factor in their renewal decisions
- **55%** of customers report being more satisfied when digital channels are integrated with human support for complex queries
- **62%** of insurers who have implemented advanced analytics report measurable improvement in customer retention rates

#### What the Opportunity Looks Like

AI-powered tools enable insurers to shift from reactive, claim-triggered interactions to **proactive, value-adding engagement**:
- Usage-based auto policies that reward safe driving in real time
- Homeowner policies that notify customers of weather risks before damage occurs
- Life policies that offer premium discounts tied to fitness tracker data
- Health policies that surface preventive care recommendations at the right moment

The long-term prize is **loyalty** — customers who feel their insurer genuinely understands and anticipates their needs are far less price-sensitive and more likely to consolidate their coverage with a single carrier.

---

### Trend 2: Agent/Advisor Engagement (P&C, Life)

**Headline**: *"Empowering agents with AI tools and digital capabilities to enhance productivity and customer value."*

#### Background

Despite the rise of direct-to-consumer digital channels, **agents and advisors remain the dominant sales channel** for complex insurance products — particularly in life and commercial P&C. But agents are working with tools that haven't kept pace with their customers' sophistication. Outdated CRM systems, fragmented policy administration platforms, and information-heavy workflows leave agents spending more time on administration than on advising.

#### Key Data Points

- **54%** of P&C agents say they spend more than a quarter of their working time on administrative tasks that don't directly add customer value
- **63%** of life agents say that better AI and digital tools would significantly improve their ability to serve customers
- **47%** increase in sales productivity has been documented when agents are equipped with AI-powered tools and digital workspaces

#### What the Opportunity Looks Like

The agent of 2026 doesn't need to be replaced by AI — they need to be **augmented** by it. Key capabilities include:
- **AI copilots** that surface real-time product recommendations, competitive comparisons, and compliance guidance during customer calls
- **Smart CRM** that automatically logs interactions, flags upsell triggers, and prioritizes the most valuable next actions
- **Digital workspaces** that consolidate policy data, claims history, and customer communication into a single, intuitive interface
- **Automated quoting tools** that generate accurate, personalized proposals in seconds

When agents spend less time navigating systems and more time having genuine conversations, both conversion rates and customer satisfaction scores improve.

---

### Trend 3: Opening the Youth Segment (Life)

**Headline**: *"Life insurers reimagine products and engagement to attract and retain younger customers."*

#### Background

The life insurance industry faces a generational crisis. Younger consumers — Millennials and Gen Z — are largely disengaged from traditional life insurance. They perceive it as expensive, complicated, and irrelevant to their life stage. The industry's traditional distribution model (agent-led, paper-heavy, jargon-dense) was designed for a different era and a different customer.

Meanwhile, **60% of consumers remain underinsured or completely without life coverage** — and a disproportionate share of that gap is among people under 40. This is not just a social problem; it represents an enormous untapped revenue opportunity for carriers who can design products and experiences that resonate with younger demographics.

#### Key Data Points

- **74%** of young adults ages 18–40 say they are more likely to purchase life insurance from a company that offers integrated wellness incentives
- **69%** of Millennials and Gen Z prefer digital-first, embedded, and on-demand insurance products over traditional models
- **45%** of younger customers say they are more likely to remain loyal to an insurer that offers gamification features and personalized rewards programs

#### What the Opportunity Looks Like

Reaching younger customers requires rethinking life insurance at the product level, not just the marketing level:
- **Micro-term, on-demand coverage**: Short-term life policies that can be turned on and off via mobile app for specific high-risk periods (travel, adventure sports, new parenthood)
- **Embedded distribution**: Life coverage bundled into mortgage applications, employer benefits platforms, or consumer finance products
- **Wellness-linked premiums**: Premium discounts or rewards points tied to fitness app data, preventive health check-ups, or mental health app usage
- **Gamified financial literacy**: Interactive tools that help younger customers understand coverage needs and build engagement without the pressure of a sales conversation

The opportunity is to convert an entire generation from life insurance skeptics into loyal, multi-product customers.

---

### Trend 4: Collaboration for Customization (Health)

**Headline**: *"Health insurers forge ecosystem partnerships to deliver personalized coverage and integrated care."*

#### Background

The health insurance sector sits at the intersection of the most complex data challenges in the entire industry. Member health data is scattered across primary care providers, specialists, hospitals, pharmacies, wearable devices, and mental health apps — and most of it is neither accessible nor actionable for the insurer designing a member's coverage.

This fragmentation creates a vicious cycle: insurers can't personalize because they lack data; they lack data because ecosystem partnerships are immature; partnerships are immature because data-sharing infrastructure and regulatory frameworks are still developing.

#### Key Data Points

- **60%** of health insurance customers say they are willing to share their personal health data in exchange for more personalized coverage options
- **52%** of health insurers say they plan to significantly expand ecosystem partnerships to offer more customized products within the next two years
- **49%** of customers say that accessing integrated health and insurance services through a single digital platform would meaningfully improve their overall experience

#### What the Opportunity Looks Like

The most successful health insurers of 2026 are building **ecosystem architectures** rather than standalone products:
- **Partnerships with health tech companies** (Apple Health, Fitbit, Whoop, mental health apps) to ingest real-time health signals into coverage and wellness programs
- **Provider network integrations** that enable seamless data exchange between claims systems and clinical records
- **Wellness platform collaborations** that turn the insurer-member relationship from annual renewal transaction into ongoing engagement
- **Single-app experiences** that combine insurance management, provider search, care navigation, and health tracking in one interface

The prize is a health insurance product that feels less like a financial service and more like a health partner — one that is with the member every day, not just when they file a claim.

---

### Use Cases — Distribution and Engagement

- **Legal & General (Life)**: Enhanced advisor digital workspace to increase productivity and customer conversation quality
- **WPA (Health)**: Built ecosystem partnerships with wellness providers to offer integrated health and insurance experiences

---

## Pillar 2: Operational Efficiency

### Overview

Operational efficiency is not just about cutting costs — in 2026, it is about building the operational foundation that makes AI, personalization, and ecosystem partnerships possible. Three headline statistics frame the pillar:

- **45%** of P&C insurers cite process optimization as a significant driver of their IT investment decisions
- More than **50%** of life insurers consider digital policy-servicing portals and centralized CRM systems as critical infrastructure investments
- By **2028**, 67% of health insurers anticipate that rising healthcare demand will cause a significant increase in their medical costs — making operational efficiency a survival imperative, not just a margin story

---

### Trend 5: Data for Intelligence (P&C, Life, Health)

**Headline**: *"Federated data streamlines operations, enhances engagement, and empowers decision making with actionable intelligence."*

#### Background

Insurance generates more data than almost any other industry — claims evidence, actuarial records, customer interactions, medical records, telematics data, satellite imagery, IoT sensor feeds, and more. The problem is not a shortage of data; it is the inability to integrate it. Data lives in departmental silos, legacy systems speak different languages, and data quality varies dramatically across sources.

The result: underwriters price risks with incomplete information; claims adjusters duplicate work already done by other functions; customer service agents lack context that would make interactions more valuable; and actuaries rely on historical patterns that may not reflect emerging risks.

#### Key Data Points

- **70%** of insurers identify data integrity and quality as a key challenge affecting their ability to operate effectively
- **69%** of insurers are actively embedding data and insights directly into core business workflows, enabling business-led (rather than IT-led) data ownership
- **42%** are already using GenAI in data management processes to drive democratization — surfacing insights that previously required a data science team to extract

#### What the Opportunity Looks Like

The vision is an **enterprise data marketplace** — a unified platform where any function (underwriting, claims, marketing, finance) can access clean, governed, real-time data without needing to request it from IT:
- **Claims leakage reduction**: AI identifies patterns of overpayment, fraud, and subrogation opportunities that human adjusters miss
- **Pricing optimization**: Real-time data feeds improve risk segmentation, reducing adverse selection and improving loss ratios
- **Personalized policy design**: Customer data platforms enable carriers to build coverage packages tailored to individual risk profiles
- **Regulatory reporting**: Automated data pipelines reduce the cost and error rate of compliance reporting across multiple jurisdictions

---

### Trend 6: Underwriting Evolution (P&C primarily)

**Headline**: *"Insurers invest in advanced, intelligent, and collaborative underwriting tools and platforms to innovate risk models."*

#### Background

Underwriting is the core of the insurance value chain — and it is still heavily dependent on manual processes. In many carriers, underwriters navigate between multiple systems, manually extract data from PDF submissions, cross-reference static guideline documents, and use spreadsheet-based tools to arrive at risk assessments. This approach is slow, inconsistent, and leaves significant margin on the table through mispriced risks.

The challenge is compounded by the increasing complexity of risks themselves: cyber exposures, climate volatility, supply chain interdependencies, and emerging technology risks are straining traditional actuarial models built on decades of historical loss data.

#### Key Data Points

- **56%** of underwriters still rely primarily on static guidelines — PDFs and spreadsheets — for complex commercial risk assessment
- **35%** of insurers note that AI/ML and predictive models significantly enhance their ability to understand and price emerging risks
- **68%** of insurers that have implemented advanced underwriting technology report measurable reductions in loss ratios and improvements in profitability

#### What the Opportunity Looks Like

The intelligent underwriting platform of 2026 combines multiple capabilities into a unified workflow:
- **GenAI submission processing**: Large language models extract structured risk data from unstructured broker submissions (PDFs, emails, spreadsheets) in seconds, eliminating manual data entry
- **Predictive risk models**: ML models trained on claims outcomes, third-party data, and alternative data sources deliver more precise risk scores than traditional actuarial tables
- **Collaborative workspaces**: Underwriters, actuaries, risk engineers, and claims teams share a single view of each risk — breaking the silo between pricing and loss prevention
- **Automated appetite management**: AI systems identify which submissions fall within risk appetite, freeing underwriters to focus on complex accounts that genuinely require human judgment

The result is faster quote turnaround, better pricing accuracy, improved loss ratios, and the ability to take on new classes of risk that were previously too complex to underwrite profitably.

---

### Trend 7: Focus on Value (Health)

**Headline**: *"Value-based care continues to gain traction through enhanced payer/provider collaboration and robust provider data management and analytics."*

#### Background

The traditional health insurance model is built around **fee-for-service**: providers are paid for each service they deliver, regardless of whether that service improves the patient's health. This creates structural misalignment — more procedures mean more revenue, not better outcomes. The resulting cost spiral is unsustainable: healthcare costs are rising globally, administrative complexity is growing, and patient outcomes in many markets remain poor relative to spending levels.

**Value-based care (VBC)** is the alternative model: providers are paid based on patient outcomes, quality metrics, and cost efficiency — not volume. When executed well, VBC improves care quality while reducing total costs. But making VBC work requires deep data integration between payers and providers — the kind of integration that most healthcare systems are still far from achieving.

#### Key Data Points

- **40%** of health insurance customers say they are willing to share their personal health data if it results in more personalized advice or better coverage options
- **43%** of health insurers identify low customer engagement with preventive health services as a primary driver of rising medical costs
- More than **80%** of payers in the United States say that AI and advanced analytics tools enhance efficiency and significantly reduce administrative costs in value-based care programs

#### What the Opportunity Looks Like

Building a successful value-based care infrastructure requires three things:
1. **Data integration**: Real-time exchange of claims data, clinical records, and social determinants of health between payers and providers — enabled by FHIR APIs and integrated data platforms
2. **Analytics capability**: Tools to track patient outcomes, benchmark provider performance against peers, and identify care gaps before they become expensive complications
3. **Contract innovation**: Moving from fee-for-service to outcome-linked, value-based contracts with shared savings/risk arrangements that align provider incentives with cost efficiency

The Bupa case study (from the use cases section) illustrates what is possible: a value-based care pilot with Cleveland Clinic London that replaced fee-for-service billing with outcome-based payments — improving care quality while eliminating unnecessary consultant fees.

---

### Trend 8: Climate and Catastrophe Resilience (P&C primarily)

**Headline**: *"Risk concentration, regulatory requirements, and strict reinsurance terms propel insurers to adopt climate-resilient risk models."*

#### Background

Climate change is rewriting the risk landscape for P&C insurers faster than traditional actuarial models can adapt. Secondary perils — flooding, wildfires, hailstorms, severe convective storms — that were once considered manageable attritional losses have become **primary drivers of catastrophe losses**. The geography of risk is shifting: populations are concentrating in coastal zones, wildland-urban interfaces, and flood plains, even as those areas become more hazardous.

Meanwhile, the reinsurance market is tightening: reinsurers are raising rates, reducing capacity in high-risk zones, and demanding more granular data from primary carriers. Regulators are imposing mandatory climate scenario analysis and capital adequacy tests. The combination is forcing a fundamental rethink of how P&C insurers assess, price, and manage climate risk.

#### Key Data Points

- **41%** of global insured catastrophe losses in 2024 were caused by **Severe Convective Storms (SCS)** — a secondary peril that traditional CAT models significantly underestimate
- **70%** of the global population is projected to live in urban centers by 2050, increasing concentration risk in cities with inadequate climate resilience infrastructure
- **71%** of insurers say they are actively planning to factor customers' climate adaptation and mitigation practices into their underwriting decisions

#### What the Opportunity Looks Like

Building a climate-resilient underwriting model requires investment in three areas:
- **High-resolution hazard mapping**: Moving from zip-code-level to parcel-level climate risk assessment, incorporating satellite imagery, topographic data, and real-time flood/fire monitoring
- **Dynamic risk models**: Replacing static historical loss tables with forward-looking models that incorporate IPCC climate projections, urban development trajectories, and real-time weather data
- **Customer-level risk dialogue**: Using climate data to have proactive conversations with policyholders about risk mitigation — roof upgrades, flood barriers, fire-resistant landscaping — that reduce both losses and premiums

The carriers that build these capabilities will be able to remain viable in high-risk markets where others are retreating, price more precisely, and turn climate risk into a product differentiation advantage.

---

### Use Cases — Operational Efficiency

**Americas:**
- **US P&C Insurer**: Centralized property data with geo-spatial analytics, identifying risk concentration and multimillion-dollar missed coverage limits across their portfolio
- **US Life Insurer**: Implemented a unified customer data platform that reduced retargeting campaign build time from 1 day to 5 minutes, increased quote generation by **+60%**, and improved email open rates by **+24%**
- **Independence Blue Cross (Health)**: Deployed Epic Payer Platform to streamline clinical data exchange with providers, boosting operational efficiency and member trust

**Europe and Asia-Pacific:**
- **Allianz UK (P&C)**: Deployed the **BRIAN** GenAI assistant for underwriting documentation. The tool eliminated the need for manual searches across policy documents, saving **65,000 minutes** of underwriter time — freeing teams to focus on complex risk analysis rather than information retrieval
- **APAC Life Insurer**: Adopted a low-code/no-code cloud workflow platform that reduced dispute resolution time by **50%**, improved claims assessment efficiency by **70%**, and accelerated new product growth by **70%**
- **Bupa (Health)**: Launched a first-of-its-kind value-based care pilot with Cleveland Clinic London, replacing fee-for-service billing with outcome-based payment models that improved patient outcomes while eliminating unnecessary consultant fees

---

## Pillar 3: Technological Innovation

### Overview

Technology investment in insurance has historically been reactive — driven by regulatory mandates, competitive pressure, or the need to fix aging infrastructure. The 2026 trends signal a different dynamic: insurers are beginning to treat technology as a **strategic capability**, not just a cost center. Three headline statistics set the context:

- **Nearly 50%** of P&C insurers are actively investing in or planning to invest in modernizing their IT systems specifically to enable GenAI capabilities
- **41%** of life insurers cite technology limitations as the primary barrier preventing them from achieving their core business goals
- **56%** of health insurers identify care overuse driven by poor coordination as a primary driver of rising medical costs — a problem that better technology can directly address

---

### Trend 9: Legacy Modernization (P&C, Life, Health)

**Headline**: *"Insurers modernize core systems to enhance experience, flexibility, and agility."*

#### Background

Legacy systems are the single biggest constraint on innovation across the insurance industry. Core policy administration systems, claims platforms, and actuarial tools at many carriers were built decades ago — in some cases before the internet — and have accumulated layers of customization, integration patches, and workarounds that make them increasingly difficult to maintain, modify, or connect to modern data infrastructure.

The problem is not just technical debt. Legacy systems impose a **strategic ceiling**: new products cannot be launched quickly because the policy admin system can't accommodate them; AI models can't be trained effectively because the data is locked in inaccessible formats; customer experiences remain clunky because the front-end cannot connect to back-end data in real time.

#### Key Data Points

- **72%** of insurers cite data integration with legacy systems as a significant or critical barrier to innovation initiatives
- **50%** acknowledge that they are behind schedule in their own plans to phase out legacy systems — meaning the gap between aspiration and reality is widening, not closing
- **78%** of insurers are leveraging cloud infrastructure as their primary vehicle for driving operational efficiency and unlocking architectural agility

#### What the Opportunity Looks Like

The path to legacy modernization is not a single "rip and replace" event — it is a **phased, capability-by-capability migration** that reduces risk while progressively unlocking new possibilities:
- **Cloud migration**: Moving workloads from on-premises to cloud infrastructure reduces maintenance costs, improves scalability, and enables API-first connectivity
- **Microservices architecture**: Breaking monolithic core systems into modular components that can be upgraded independently without disrupting the whole
- **GenAI-assisted modernization**: Large language models can analyze existing COBOL, Fortran, or legacy Java codebases, generate documentation, and accelerate migration by automating code translation tasks that previously required specialized (and expensive) developers
- **API layers**: Building abstraction APIs on top of legacy systems allows modern front-ends and AI tools to access core data without waiting for full system replacement

For carriers that get this right, the reward is the ability to launch new products in weeks rather than months, integrate with ecosystem partners in days rather than quarters, and deploy AI capabilities that can actually reach and act on core operational data.

---

### Trend 10: AI Transformation at Scale (P&C, Life, Health)

**Headline**: *"Insurers move beyond pilots to systematically integrate AI across operations, reshaping organizational models for measurable impact."*

#### Background

Almost every insurer has run AI pilots. Many have demonstrated impressive results in isolated functions — a claims chatbot that reduces call volume, a fraud detection model that catches more suspicious claims, a pricing algorithm that improves loss ratios in one product line. But **the gap between a successful pilot and enterprise-wide AI transformation is enormous** — and most insurers are stuck in it.

The barriers are structural: AI pilots are typically owned by individual business units with their own data, their own models, and their own governance frameworks. When a model succeeds in one department, it cannot easily be extended to others because the data is fragmented, the architecture is siloed, and the organizational model doesn't support cross-functional AI deployment.

The result is **technical debt, inconsistent governance, and limited ROI** — not because the AI doesn't work, but because the organization hasn't been designed to benefit from it.

#### Key Data Points

- **49%** of insurers have deployed GenAI fully or partially across multiple business functions — up from much lower levels just two years ago
- **40%** are using GenAI specifically in data management to transform complex, unstructured analyses into actionable narratives that business users can act on without data science support
- **46%** of insurers say AI has the most positive operational impact on **underwriting and risk profiling** — with claims (20%) and customer service (18%) also showing meaningful benefits

#### What the Opportunity Looks Like

True AI transformation at scale requires three organizational changes, not just technology upgrades:

1. **Enterprise AI architecture**: A shared AI platform with common data infrastructure, model governance, and API access that allows any business function to deploy and benefit from AI without rebuilding everything from scratch
2. **Cross-functional data access**: Breaking down the data ownership silos between underwriting, claims, finance, and customer service — so that an AI model trained on one function's data can be enriched by signals from all functions
3. **New operating models**: Rethinking roles and processes around AI capabilities — not just automating what humans currently do, but redesigning workflows from scratch to take advantage of what AI does best (pattern recognition, anomaly detection, continuous monitoring, personalization at scale)

When executed successfully, enterprise-wide AI enables: automated underwriting decisions for standard risks; real-time fraud detection across claims, applications, and billing; personalized policy management that adjusts coverage continuously; and risk monitoring that catches emerging exposures before they become losses.

---

## Conclusion

The ten trends in Capgemini's Insurance Top Trends 2026 collectively describe an industry in the middle of a fundamental transformation — one that is being driven simultaneously from the customer side (rising expectations for personalization, digital access, and integrated value) and from the operational side (AI capabilities that can finally deliver on those expectations if the data infrastructure is ready).

The report's implicit message is one of urgency. The technology is available. The customer demand is clear. The financial case for investment is proven. What separates the leaders from the laggards in 2026 insurance is not the presence of ambition, but the **willingness to make the hard organizational and infrastructure changes** that allow AI and data capabilities to actually reach the customer, the agent, and the underwriter in meaningful ways.

Insurers that invest in data unification, legacy modernization, and enterprise AI governance now will enter 2027 with structural advantages in pricing precision, customer loyalty, operational efficiency, and speed to market that will be very difficult for slower movers to close.

## 결론

캡제미니 보험 Top 트렌드 2026의 10가지 트렌드는 동시에 두 방향에서 근본적 변혁이 진행 중인 산업을 묘사합니다: 고객 측(개인화·디지털 접근·통합 가치에 대한 기대 상승)과 운영 측(AI 역량이 마침내 데이터 인프라가 준비된다면 그 기대를 충족할 수 있는 수준으로 발전).

보고서의 암묵적 메시지는 **긴급성**입니다. 기술은 이미 있습니다. 고객 수요는 명확합니다. 투자의 재무적 근거는 입증되었습니다. 2026년 보험업에서 선도자와 후발자를 가르는 것은 포부의 존재 여부가 아니라, **AI와 데이터 역량이 고객·에이전트·언더라이터에게 실질적으로 도달할 수 있도록 만드는 어렵고 근본적인 조직·인프라 변화를 실행할 의지**입니다.
