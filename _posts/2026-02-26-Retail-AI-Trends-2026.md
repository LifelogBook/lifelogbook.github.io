# Part 1: English Summary

## Report Overview

- **Source**: Capgemini Applied Innovation Exchange (AIE), *"From hype to how: Retail AI Trends 2026"*
- **Authors**: Kacey Burden (Innovation Strategist and Operations Lead, Capgemini AIE) & Alexander Fleischer (Executive Director Innovation Ecosystem, Capgemini AIE)
- **Context**: Field observations from **NRF 2026** — the National Retail Federation's annual flagship conference (the world's largest retail trade show)
- **Core Message**: *"Less wow, more how."* — AI in retail is shifting from experimentation and hype to practical execution and industrialization.

The central question at NRF 2026 was no longer *"What can AI do?"* It became *"How do we execute, scale, and measure success?"* This subtle but profound shift signals that the retail industry has entered a new phase of AI adoption — one defined not by demos, but by deployment.

---

## The Big Picture: From Experimentation to Industrialization

### The Shift in the Room

At NRF 2025, AI demonstrations were dominated by flashy chatbot assistants and generative AI showcases. At NRF 2026, the energy had fundamentally changed. The show floor was full of **operational AI** — systems quietly embedded in pricing engines, inventory management tools, store associate platforms, and customer journey orchestration.

This shift carries a critical implication for retailers: **execution is now the differentiator**. The organizations that will win are not those with the most impressive AI demos, but those that can connect, govern, and measure AI tools across their entire operations.

### Seven Key Observations from NRF 2026

1. **Less wow, more how**: Retail AI has moved past the "what is possible" phase. Conversations were overwhelmingly practical — ROI, integration challenges, organizational change, and governance.
2. **Rewiring with AI**: AI is becoming the connective tissue — linking data, decisions, and workflows end-to-end, from merchandising to the customer's door.
3. **Agentic commerce is reality**: AI can now act *on behalf of* customers — searching, comparing, selecting, and completing purchases. Retailers must design seamless, secure, and personalized experiences for this new era.
4. **From transaction to trust**: The physical store's role is being redefined — not as a transaction point, but as a place where brand identity, values, and trust are reinforced.
5. **Physical stores run on digital tech**: Smart store platforms, robotics, dynamic content, and IoT-driven automation are becoming table stakes.
6. **Collaboration is king**: Partnerships between retailers and big tech / enterprise platform providers (Microsoft, Google, Shopify, Salesforce) are accelerating. No retailer is building this infrastructure alone.
7. **Execution is the differentiator**: Competitive advantage comes from being able to connect, govern, and use AI tools effectively — not just from adopting them.

### The Prerequisite No One Wants to Talk About

A recurring theme across NRF 2026: **AI cannot connect what the organization has already neglected**. Before any agentic or generative AI can function well, retailers must have:

- **Clean, unified data** — fragmented data across legacy systems is the #1 barrier
- **Clear data permissions and governance frameworks** — especially for customer data
- **Organizational alignment** — siloed teams undermine AI's ability to act across functions

As the report states: the infrastructure of intelligence must be built before the intelligence can flow.

## Trend 1: Agents Get Practical — Rewiring Day-to-Day Retail Execution with AI

### Agentic AI Moves Off the Stage and Into Operations

Agentic AI dominated NRF 2026 across three domains: **commerce** (shopping agents, cart management, checkout), **service** (virtual associates, returns handling), and **marketing** (campaign optimization, personalization at scale). But the notable shift was in *how* agentic AI was being presented.

Gone were the polished demos of AI assistants reading out product descriptions. In their place were practical, embedded tools that quietly handled thousands of micro-decisions per hour — adjusting prices, reallocating inventory, triggering replenishment orders, and flagging performance anomalies.

### AI as Embedded Platform Capability (Not a Point Solution)

The most important design principle emerging from NRF 2026 was the distinction between:

- **Point solutions**: Standalone AI tools that solve one problem in isolation (e.g., a chatbot for returns)
- **Embedded platform capabilities**: AI built into the core operating platform, connected to all relevant data streams

The industry consensus was clear: **bolt-on tools don't scale**. Retailers that tried to layer AI on top of fragmented systems reported frustration, low adoption, and poor ROI. Those that embedded AI into unified platforms — or rebuilt their platforms around AI-first principles — were seeing results.

### Usability Over Intelligence

Another counterintuitive finding: **usability mattered more than intelligence**. The most impressive AI systems at NRF 2026 were not necessarily the most technically sophisticated — they were the ones that store associates and customers could actually use without friction. Design for adoption, not just capability.

### Real-World AI Examples from NRF 2026

**7Learnings**
A dynamic pricing and performance marketing platform that uses AI agents to continuously optimize pricing, product ordering, and marketing spend. The system learns from competitor pricing signals, demand patterns, and margin targets simultaneously — removing the need for manual intervention across hundreds of SKUs.

**Profitmind**
An AI agent platform that identifies growth opportunities across pricing, inventory, and assortment. Profitmind surfaces specific, actionable recommendations (e.g., "reduce inventory of SKU #4521 in Store 12 and redistribute to high-demand Store 47") rather than generic dashboards. The emphasis is on turning AI insight into operational action.

**Ask Ralph (Ralph Lauren + Microsoft)**
A conversational AI styling companion designed specifically for the Ralph Lauren brand experience. Rather than a generic chatbot, Ask Ralph is trained to reflect Ralph Lauren's brand identity, aesthetic values, and tone of voice. This is a prime example of **brand-right AI** — where the AI's personality and behavior are as important as its technical capability.

### The Trust Imperative

Data from Capgemini's companion research *"What Matters to Today's Consumer 2026"* reveals how cautious consumers remain about AI:

- **71%** of shoppers are concerned about how Gen AI collects and uses their personal data
- **76%** want the ability to set strict boundaries for a digital assistant before using it
- **66%** say they trust a digital assistant more when it provides clear explanations of why it made a recommendation

These numbers underscore a critical design requirement: **transparency and control are not nice-to-have features — they are prerequisites for consumer adoption**. AI that feels opaque or unpredictable will be abandoned, no matter how smart it is.

### Key Insights from the Authors

**Alexander Fleischer** (Executive Director, Innovation Ecosystem):
> *"AI is not the headline, but the wiring. We're seeing the shift from AI as 'a feature' into AI as an operating layer inside the business."*

**Kacey Burden** (Innovation Strategist):
> *"The most effective AI isn't just fast or smart — it's brand-right, trust-building, and genuinely enhances the customer experience."*

## Trend 2: Simplify to Scale — Connected Platforms Power Agentic Commerce

### The Infrastructure of Agentic Commerce

For AI agents to function effectively in commerce — searching for products, comparing prices, applying promotions, completing checkout — they need to communicate seamlessly across different retailer, marketplace, and platform environments. Today, this is technically fragmented. Each platform speaks its own language, creating barriers for agents that try to act across ecosystems.

NRF 2026's most significant infrastructure announcement was the **Universal Commerce Protocol (UCP)**.

### Universal Commerce Protocol (UCP): Google + Shopify

At NRF 2026, **Google and Shopify jointly announced the Universal Commerce Protocol (UCP)** — a shared technical standard designed to make agentic commerce interoperable at scale.

What UCP enables:
- AI agents can **discover products** across multiple retailer catalogs simultaneously
- Agents can **access real-time inventory** from participating merchants
- Agents can **apply pricing and promotions** based on customer eligibility
- Agents can **complete checkout** — all within a single conversational flow, regardless of which merchant's platform hosts the product

The significance of UCP is enormous. It signals that the major platform players believe **interoperability is the foundational requirement** for the agentic commerce era — not a competitive advantage to be withheld, but a shared infrastructure investment that expands the entire market.

### From Omnichannel to Unified Commerce

For a decade, "omnichannel" was retail's operating mantra — the idea that customers should experience a consistent journey across web, app, and store. But NRF 2026 signaled the next evolution: **unified commerce**.

The distinction matters:
- **Omnichannel** focuses on consistent customer experience across channels (often achieved by stitching together separate channel systems)
- **Unified commerce** is a single, real-time platform that orchestrates **data, inventory, pricing, and fulfillment** simultaneously — not channel by channel, but as one integrated operating system

Unified commerce is what makes agentic AI possible at scale. An AI agent cannot make intelligent decisions about product availability, delivery timing, or promotional eligibility if the underlying data is siloed across five different systems.

### The Shifting Nature of Product Discovery

One of the most profound behavioral shifts highlighted at NRF 2026 is happening in **how customers discover products**:

**Traditional path**: Customer types keywords into a search bar → scrolls through results → clicks product pages → adds to cart

**Emerging path**: Customer asks a conversational AI assistant a contextual question ("I need a gift for my 8-year-old nephew who loves space") → AI surfaces curated options based on preferences, budget, and real-time availability → customer confirms selection → agent completes purchase

This shift from **keyword search to conversational discovery** has enormous implications for SEO, product catalog management, content strategy, and promotional design. Products that don't surface well in AI-mediated discovery will simply not be found.

### Anticipatory Commerce: The Unit of Commerce Becomes the Moment

The most forward-looking concept introduced at NRF 2026 was **anticipatory commerce** — a model in which AI agents don't just respond to customer requests but proactively anticipate needs and take action.

In anticipatory commerce, AI agents are informed by:
- **Replenishment signals**: "You usually reorder dog food every 3 weeks — it's been 3 weeks and 2 days."
- **Time constraints**: "You have a dinner party tonight and your usual grocery store shows low stock of olive oil."
- **Location context**: "You're 200 meters from a store that carries your preferred brand."
- **Trust signals**: "This is the 12th time this agent has made a recommendation you accepted."
- **Preference history**: Accumulated understanding of size, style, dietary restrictions, brand loyalty

In this model, the customer's role shifts from active shopper to **informed approver** — reviewing and confirming actions that the AI agent has already prepared or partially executed.

**Key insight from Sebastien Jouvenaar** (VP Strategy & Innovation, frog; Head of Applied Innovation Exchange, Capgemini):
> *"In anticipatory commerce, decisions are no longer driven by categories — they're shaped by context. The unit of commerce becomes the moment, not the merchandise."*

### The Real Barriers to Agentic Commerce

**Key insight from Sanjay Nand** (Head of Applied Innovation Exchange, Capgemini UK):
> *"The barriers to agentic commerce are no longer intelligence or technical feasibility, but integration, interoperability, trust, and provable ROI."*

This is a striking reframing. The bottleneck is no longer AI capability — it is the organizational and infrastructure readiness to deploy that capability at scale, with measurable outcomes that justify continued investment.

## Trend 3: All-in-One Retail — Physical Store | Digital Tech | Human Experience

### Physical Stores Are More Important Than Ever

Against the backdrop of rapidly advancing AI and e-commerce growth, NRF 2026 delivered an emphatic message: **the physical store is not dying — it is evolving into something more important and more differentiated**.

Consumer data from Capgemini's *"What Matters to Today's Consumer 2026"* paints a nuanced picture:
- **56%** of consumers have already used Gen AI shopping tools or plan to in the near future
- **53%** have made at least one purchase based on an AI recommendation
- **74%** say they still value **human interaction** during in-store shopping experiences

These numbers reveal a retail consumer who is increasingly comfortable with AI in the shopping journey, but who still fundamentally values what only a physical human presence can provide.

### From Transaction to Trust: The New Role of the Store

The physical store's role is undergoing a fundamental redefinition:

**Old role**: A place to complete a transaction — browse, find, buy.

**New role**: A place to build and reinforce trust — experience the brand, verify quality, receive expertise, form a human connection.

This shift has profound implications for store design, associate training, and technology investment. A store optimized purely for transaction efficiency (checkout speed, inventory density, labor cost minimization) is a store optimized for a role that is rapidly being displaced by e-commerce and AI agents.

### Three Things Stores Offer That AI Alone Cannot

The report identifies three irreplaceable elements of the physical retail experience:

**1. Sensory Experience**
AI can describe a fabric's softness, a fragrance's character, or a mattress's firmness level. But it cannot reproduce the actual sensation of touching, smelling, or lying down. For product categories where sensory evaluation is central to the purchase decision — fashion, beauty, furniture, food — the store provides something that no amount of AI sophistication can replicate.

**2. Human Expertise**
AI can surface a product recommendation based on stated preferences and purchase history. A skilled human associate can notice that a customer's body language suggests uncertainty, ask a follow-up question that reveals an unspoken need, and contextualize an AI recommendation in a way that makes it feel personally relevant rather than algorithmically generated. Human judgment, empathy, and contextual awareness remain deeply valuable in complex or high-stakes purchase decisions.

**3. Real Human Interaction**
At its deepest level, trust between a brand and a customer is often built through face-to-face human interaction — the reassurance of being helped by a real person who is accountable, the emotional connection of being genuinely understood, and the social experience of shopping as a shared human activity. No AI — however sophisticated — currently reproduces the full texture of genuine human presence.

### AI Augments Associates; It Doesn't Replace Them

A key strategic message from NRF 2026: **AI should free associates from transactional tasks so they can focus on what humans do best**. The most effective store technology deployments at NRF were those that visibly enhanced (rather than displaced) the associate's role:

**Tools for associates** (back-of-house / operational AI):
- **YOOBIC**: A frontline digital workplace platform that delivers training, task management, and communications to store associates' mobile devices — reducing manager overhead and improving consistency
- **Salesfloor**: An AI-powered clienteling tool that helps associates deliver personalized outreach to customers based on purchase history and preference data
- **Frogmi**: A store operations platform that uses AI to route tasks, flag compliance issues, and manage store execution at scale

**Tools for shoppers** (in-store AI experiences):
- **Temi**: An autonomous AI-powered robot shopping assistant that navigates store aisles, answers customer questions, and guides shoppers to products
- **Cust2Mate**: A smart shopping cart with embedded screens that provide personalized product recommendations, navigate customers to items on their list, and enable checkout directly from the cart
- **VenHub**: A fully autonomous, cashierless convenience retail concept operating 24/7 — combining AI-powered inventory management, computer vision checkout, and smart contract integration

### Retail Media in Physical Space

An emerging trend that gained significant floor space at NRF 2026: **retail media is moving into the physical store**.

Historically, retail media (brands paying retailers to display advertising alongside search results and product pages) was a purely digital phenomenon. NRF 2026 showed the next evolution:
- **Digital shelf displays**: Dynamically updated electronic shelf labels and screen modules that can serve brand-sponsored content in real time
- **Smart signage**: Large-format displays that deliver personalized content based on factors like time of day, local inventory, or even demographic signals from computer vision
- **Real-time personalization**: Promotional offers triggered at the shelf level by customer loyalty data, purchase proximity, or competitor pricing signals

Retail media in physical stores represents a significant new revenue stream for retailers — effectively monetizing in-store attention the same way that Amazon and Walmart have monetized digital shelf space.

## Three Strategic Recommendations

### Recommendation 1: Unify the Organization Through AI

Deploy AI as a **shared operating layer** — not a collection of departmental tools. Pricing decisions, inventory signals, marketing campaigns, and store operations should all draw from the same underlying data and intelligence layer. This requires:
- Breaking down data silos between merchandising, supply chain, and customer experience teams
- Establishing shared data governance standards
- Selecting platform providers that prioritize integration over proprietary lock-in

When AI is unified across functions, the compound effect of consistent signals — rather than conflicting departmental outputs — creates an exponential improvement in decision quality.

### Recommendation 2: Anchor All Platform Decisions in Interoperability

Move away from standalone, bolt-on tools toward **connected, scalable platforms**. The UCP announcement by Google and Shopify is a signal: the industry is converging on open standards. Retailers who invest in proprietary, closed-system AI tools risk finding themselves stranded as interoperable ecosystems become the norm.

Practical criteria for platform evaluation:
- Does this platform connect to the systems we already use?
- Can AI agents from third parties access and act on our data through open protocols?
- Does this platform have a credible roadmap for the agentic commerce era?

### Recommendation 3: Design Stores to Verify Trust and Deepen Human Connection

Use digital technology to handle **discovery, navigation, checkout, and routine product inquiries in the background** — freeing associates for the high-value human interactions that build loyalty and justify the cost of physical retail.

Specifically:
- Invest in associate-facing AI tools that surface information, not replace judgment
- Design physical spaces that facilitate interaction (not just transaction)
- Train associates to confidently contextualize and augment AI recommendations rather than defer to them blindly
- Use in-store technology to make customer data accessible to associates, not just algorithms

---

## Conclusion

NRF 2026 sent three clear messages:

1. **AI must be unified** — deployed as an integrated operating layer, not a patchwork of point solutions
2. **Platforms must be interoperable by default** — the agentic commerce era requires shared standards and open protocols
3. **Physical stores must strengthen trust, discovery, and human connection** — becoming places that justify the customer's decision to be there in person

The title of Capgemini's report says it best: the era of hype is over. The era of *how* has begun.

- **핵심 메시지**: *"Less wow, more how(과시 줄이고, 실행으로)"* — 리테일 AI는 실험과 과대 광고에서 실질적인 실행과 산업화로 이동하고 있습니다.

---

## 큰 그림: 실험에서 산업화로

NRF 2026의 핵심 전환: "AI가 무엇을 할 수 있는가?"에서 **"어떻게 실행하고, 확장하고, 성과를 측정할 것인가?"** 로 질문이 바뀌었습니다.

이 변화는 리테일 업계가 AI 도입의 새로운 단계에 진입했음을 의미합니다 — 데모가 아니라 배포(deployment)로 정의되는 단계입니다.

### NRF 2026의 7가지 핵심 관찰

1. **Less wow, more how**: AI가 "가능성" 단계를 지났습니다. 모든 대화가 ROI, 통합 문제, 조직 변화, 거버넌스에 집중되었습니다.
2. **AI로 배선하기(Rewiring with AI)**: AI가 데이터·결정·워크플로를 상품 기획부터 고객 배송까지 연결하는 '결합 조직(connective tissue)'이 되고 있습니다.
3. **에이전틱 커머스는 현실**: AI가 이제 고객을 **대신해** 검색, 비교, 선택, 구매를 실행합니다.
4. **거래에서 신뢰로(From transaction to trust)**: 물리적 매장의 역할이 브랜드 정체성과 가치를 강화하는 공간으로 재정의됩니다.
5. **물리적 매장은 디지털 기술로 운영**: 스마트 스토어 플랫폼, 로보틱스, 다이나믹 콘텐츠가 기본 요건이 됩니다.
6. **협업이 핵심**: 리테일러와 빅테크·엔터프라이즈 플랫폼 기업(Microsoft, Google, Shopify, Salesforce) 간 파트너십이 가속화됩니다.
7. **실행이 차별화 요소**: AI 도구를 연결하고, 거버넌스를 갖추고, 효과적으로 활용하는 능력이 경쟁 우위입니다.

### 아무도 말하지 않으려 하는 전제 조건

**AI는 조직이 이미 소홀히 해온 것을 연결할 수 없습니다.** 어떤 에이전틱 AI나 생성형 AI도 다음이 준비되기 전에는 제대로 작동하지 않습니다:
- **깨끗하고 통합된 데이터** — 레거시 시스템에 분산된 데이터는 1위 장벽
- **명확한 데이터 권한 및 거버넌스 프레임워크** — 특히 고객 데이터
- **조직 전반의 정렬** — 부서 간 사일로가 AI의 기능 횡단 실행을 방해

---

## 트렌드 1: 에이전트가 실용화된다 — AI로 일상적 리테일 실행 배선하기

### 에이전틱 AI, 무대에서 현장으로

에이전틱 AI가 NRF 2026에서 커머스·서비스·마케팅 세 영역에 걸쳐 존재했지만, 주목할 변화는 *방식*에 있었습니다. 화려한 AI 어시스턴트 데모는 사라지고, 대신 가격 엔진·재고 관리·매장 직원 플랫폼에 조용히 내장된 **운영 AI**가 자리를 채웠습니다.

### AI: 포인트 솔루션이 아닌 임베디드 플랫폼 기능

- **포인트 솔루션**: 단일 문제를 고립적으로 해결하는 독립형 AI 도구 (예: 반품 처리 챗봇)
- **임베디드 플랫폼 기능**: 모든 관련 데이터 스트림에 연결된 채 핵심 운영 플랫폼에 내장된 AI

업계의 일치된 의견: **독립 추가형(bolt-on) 도구는 확장되지 않습니다.** 분산된 시스템 위에 AI를 덧붙이려 한 리테일러들은 낮은 도입률과 낮은 ROI를 경험했습니다.

### 지능보다 사용성

또 하나의 반직관적 발견: **사용성이 지능보다 중요합니다.** NRF 2026에서 가장 효과적인 AI 시스템은 기술적으로 가장 정교한 것이 아니라, 매장 직원과 고객이 마찰 없이 실제로 사용할 수 있는 것이었습니다.

### NRF 2026 실제 AI 사례

**7Learnings**: AI 에이전트가 가격, 성과 마케팅, 상품 주문을 지속적으로 최적화하는 다이나믹 프라이싱 플랫폼. 수백 개의 SKU에서 수작업 개입 없이 경쟁사 가격, 수요 패턴, 마진 목표를 동시에 학습합니다.

**Profitmind**: 가격·재고·상품 구색에서 성장 기회를 식별하는 AI 에이전트 플랫폼. 일반적인 대시보드 대신 구체적이고 실행 가능한 권고안(예: "12번 매장의 SKU #4521 재고를 줄이고 수요가 높은 47번 매장으로 재배치")을 제시합니다.

**Ask Ralph (랄프 로렌 + 마이크로소프트)**: 랄프 로렌 브랜드 경험에 특화된 대화형 스타일링 AI 동반자. 범용 챗봇이 아닌 브랜드 정체성, 미적 가치, 어조를 반영하도록 훈련된 **브랜드 친화적 AI**의 대표 사례.

### 신뢰 명제

캡제미니의 동반 조사 *"오늘날 소비자에게 중요한 것 2026"*:

- **71%**: Gen AI가 개인 데이터를 수집·사용하는 방식에 우려를 표명
- **76%**: 디지털 어시스턴트 사용 전 엄격한 경계를 설정할 수 있기를 원함
- **66%**: AI가 추천 이유를 명확히 설명할 때 더 높은 신뢰도를 느낌

→ 투명성과 통제권은 선택 기능이 아니라 소비자 도입의 **필수 전제 조건**입니다.

### 저자의 핵심 통찰

**Alexander Fleischer**: *"AI는 헤드라인이 아니라 배선입니다. AI가 '기능'에서 비즈니스 내부의 '운영 레이어'로 전환하는 것을 목격하고 있습니다."*

**Kacey Burden**: *"가장 효과적인 AI는 빠르거나 똑똑하기만 한 것이 아닙니다 — 브랜드에 적합하고, 신뢰를 구축하며, 고객 경험을 진정으로 향상시킵니다."*

## 트렌드 2: 단순화로 확장 — 연결된 플랫폼이 에이전틱 커머스를 이끈다

### 에이전틱 커머스의 인프라

AI 에이전트가 커머스에서 효과적으로 기능하려면 서로 다른 리테일러·마켓플레이스·플랫폼 환경에 걸쳐 원활하게 통신해야 합니다. 오늘날 이 인프라는 기술적으로 단편화되어 있습니다. NRF 2026의 가장 중요한 인프라 발표가 바로 **유니버설 커머스 프로토콜(UCP)**입니다.

### 유니버설 커머스 프로토콜(UCP): 구글 + 쇼피파이

NRF 2026에서 **구글과 쇼피파이가 공동으로 UCP를 발표**했습니다 — 에이전틱 커머스를 대규모로 상호 운용 가능하게 만들기 위한 공유 기술 표준입니다.

UCP가 가능하게 하는 것:
- AI 에이전트가 여러 리테일러 카탈로그에서 **상품을 검색**
- 참여 사업자의 **실시간 재고에 접근**
- 고객 자격 기준에 따라 **가격 및 프로모션 적용**
- 단일 대화 흐름 안에서 **결제 완료** — 어떤 판매자의 플랫폼을 이용하든 무관

UCP의 의미: 주요 플랫폼 기업들이 **상호 운용성을 에이전틱 커머스 시대의 기반 요건**으로 본다는 신호입니다.

### 옴니채널에서 유니파이드 커머스로

- **옴니채널**: 채널 간 일관된 고객 경험 (주로 별도 채널 시스템을 연결해 달성)
- **유니파이드 커머스**: 데이터·재고·가격·풀필먼트를 동시에 오케스트레이션하는 단일 실시간 플랫폼

유니파이드 커머스는 에이전틱 AI를 대규모로 가능하게 하는 기반입니다. 5개의 다른 시스템에 데이터가 분산되어 있다면, AI 에이전트는 상품 가용성, 배송 시간, 프로모션 자격에 대한 지능적 결정을 내릴 수 없습니다.

### 상품 발견 방식의 변화

**기존**: 검색창에 키워드 입력 → 결과 스크롤 → 상품 페이지 클릭 → 장바구니 담기

**부상 중**: AI 어시스턴트에 맥락적 질문 ("우주를 좋아하는 8살 조카에게 선물이 필요해요") → AI가 선호도·예산·실시간 재고 기반 큐레이션 옵션 제시 → 고객 확인 → 에이전트가 구매 완료

이 변화는 SEO, 상품 카탈로그 관리, 콘텐츠 전략에 엄청난 시사점을 가집니다. **AI 기반 탐색에서 잘 검색되지 않는 상품은 단순히 발견되지 않습니다.**

### 예측형 커머스: 커머스의 단위가 '순간'이 된다

**예측형 커머스(Anticipatory Commerce)**: AI 에이전트가 고객 요청에 반응하는 것을 넘어 필요를 능동적으로 예측하고 행동하는 모델.

AI 에이전트의 행동을 형성하는 요소:
- **보충 신호**: "3주마다 반려동물 사료를 재주문하시는데, 3주 2일이 지났습니다."
- **시간 제약**: "오늘 저녁 파티가 있고, 단골 마트에 올리브 오일 재고가 부족합니다."
- **위치 맥락**: "선호 브랜드 취급 매장 200m 전방에 계십니다."
- **신뢰 신호**: "이 에이전트의 추천을 12번 수락하셨습니다."

이 모델에서 고객의 역할은 **능동적 쇼퍼**에서 **정보에 입각한 승인자**로 전환됩니다.

**Sebastien Jouvenaar (VP 전략·혁신, frog) 통찰**: *"예측형 커머스에서 결정은 카테고리가 아니라 맥락에 의해 형성됩니다. 커머스의 단위는 상품이 아니라 순간이 됩니다."*

**Sanjay Nand (캡제미니 UK AIE 총괄) 통찰**: *"에이전틱 커머스의 장벽은 더 이상 지능이나 기술적 실현 가능성이 아닙니다. 통합, 상호 운용성, 신뢰, 증명 가능한 ROI입니다."*

## 트렌드 3: 올인원 리테일 — 물리적 매장 | 디지털 기술 | 인간적 경험

### 물리적 매장은 그 어느 때보다 중요하다

캡제미니 소비자 조사:
- **56%**: Gen AI 쇼핑 도구를 이미 사용했거나 가까운 미래에 사용할 계획
- **53%**: AI 추천을 기반으로 구매를 완료한 경험
- **74%**: 매장 내 쇼핑 시 **인간적 상호작용**을 여전히 중시

→ AI에 점점 익숙해지는 소비자이지만, 물리적 인간 존재만이 제공할 수 있는 것을 근본적으로 가치 있게 여깁니다.

### 거래에서 신뢰로: 매장의 새로운 역할

- **구 역할**: 거래를 완료하는 장소 — 둘러보고, 찾고, 구매
- **새 역할**: 신뢰를 구축하고 강화하는 장소 — 브랜드를 경험하고, 품질을 확인하고, 전문성을 받고, 인간적 연결을 형성

### AI가 제공할 수 없는 3가지

**1. 감각적 경험**: AI는 소재의 부드러움이나 향수의 특성을 설명할 수 있지만, 실제 감각을 재현할 수 없습니다. 패션, 뷰티, 가구, 식품처럼 감각 평가가 구매 결정의 핵심인 카테고리에서 매장은 AI가 복제할 수 없는 것을 제공합니다.

**2. 인간 전문성**: 숙련된 매장 직원은 고객의 바디랭귀지에서 불확실성을 감지하고, 말하지 않은 필요를 드러내는 추가 질문을 하고, AI 추천을 알고리즘 생성이 아닌 개인적으로 관련된 것으로 맥락화할 수 있습니다.

**3. 진정한 인간적 상호작용**: 브랜드와 고객 간의 신뢰는 종종 대면 인간 상호작용을 통해 구축됩니다 — 책임감 있는 실제 사람에게 도움 받는 안심감, 진정으로 이해받는 감정적 연결, 공유된 인간 활동으로서의 쇼핑의 사회적 경험.

### AI는 직원을 대체하는 것이 아니라 강화한다

**직원을 위한 도구(백오피스/운영 AI)**:
- **YOOBIC**: 매장 직원 모바일에 교육·작업 관리·커뮤니케이션을 제공하는 프런트라인 디지털 워크플레이스
- **Salesfloor**: 구매 이력과 선호도 데이터를 기반으로 개인화된 고객 아웃리치를 지원하는 AI 클라이언텔링 도구

- **Cust2Mate**: 개인화 추천을 제공하고 구매 목록 상품으로 안내하며 장바구니에서 바로 결제하는 스마트 쇼핑 카트
- **VenHub**: AI 재고 관리, 컴퓨터 비전 결제, 스마트 계약 통합을 결합한 완전 자율 무인 편의점 — 24시간 365일 운영

### 리테일 미디어의 물리적 공간 진출

리테일 미디어(브랜드가 검색 결과와 상품 페이지 옆에 광고를 게재하기 위해 리테일러에 비용 지불)는 이제 물리적 매장으로 진출하고 있습니다:
- **디지털 선반 디스플레이**: 실시간 브랜드 후원 콘텐츠를 제공하는 전자 가격 표시기
- **스마트 간판**: 시간대, 로컬 재고, 또는 컴퓨터 비전 신호에 따라 개인화 콘텐츠를 제공하는 대형 화면
- **실시간 개인화**: 고객 로열티 데이터, 구매 근접성, 경쟁사 가격 신호로 촉발되는 선반 수준의 프로모션 오퍼

## 3가지 전략적 권고사항

### 권고 1: AI를 통해 조직을 통합하라
AI를 **공유 운영 레이어**로 배포하세요 — 부서별 도구의 집합이 아니라. 가격 결정, 재고 신호, 마케팅 캠페인, 매장 운영이 모두 같은 기저 데이터와 인텔리전스 레이어에서 실행되어야 합니다.

### 권고 2: 모든 플랫폼 결정을 상호 운용성에 기반하라
독립형·볼트온 도구에서 벗어나 **연결되고 확장 가능한 플랫폼**으로 이동하세요. UCP 발표는 신호입니다: 업계가 오픈 스탠더드로 수렴하고 있습니다.

### 권고 3: 신뢰를 확인하고 인간적 연결을 심화하도록 매장을 설계하라
디지털 기술이 **탐색·내비게이션·결제·일상적 상품 문의를 백그라운드에서 처리**하도록 하고, 직원은 로열티를 구축하는 고가치 인간 상호작용에 집중하게 하세요.

## 결론

NRF 2026은 세 가지 명확한 메시지를 전달했습니다:
1. **AI는 통합되어야 한다** — 포인트 솔루션의 패치워크가 아닌 통합 운영 레이어로 배포
2. **플랫폼은 기본적으로 상호 운용 가능해야 한다** — 에이전틱 커머스 시대는 공유 표준과 오픈 프로토콜을 요구
3. **물리적 매장은 신뢰·탐색·인간적 연결을 강화해야 한다** — 고객이 직접 매장에 오는 결정을 정당화하는 공간

하이프의 시대는 끝났습니다. *어떻게(how)*의 시대가 시작되었습니다.
