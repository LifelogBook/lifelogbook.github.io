# Part 1: English Summary

## Report Overview

- **Source**: McKinsey & Company, Energy Solutions Division — *Global Energy Perspective 2025*
- **Scope**: Models 77 demand segments and 76 fuels across the world, forecasting through **2050**
- **Methodology**: Three energy transition scenarios with integrated supply-and-demand perspective; cost-optimal allocation of resources across all sectors and regions
- **Contributors**: 30+ McKinsey partners and senior asset leaders plus additional contributors
- **Key Questions**: How will global energy demand evolve? Which fuels will dominate? What is the realistic path to decarbonization?

The report offers one of the most comprehensive annual snapshots of the global energy system, modeling not just what *could* happen under ideal conditions, but what is *likely* to happen given real-world economic, technological, political, and behavioral constraints.

---

## The Three Scenarios Framework

McKinsey structures its outlook around **three distinct scenarios**, each representing a different pace of energy transition:

### Scenario 1: Slow Evolution
- **Temperature outcome by 2100**: **+2.7°C**
- Policy ambitions are **not achieved**; investment in clean tech slows
- Technology bottlenecks are **not addressed**; learning curves stall
- Grid build-out is **delayed**; nuclear constrained by regulation
- Energy security: **lower independence**
- Economic growth: **less than 0.5%** annual GDP growth
- Fossil fuels remain the dominant energy source well past 2050

### Scenario 2: Continued Momentum *(Base Case)*
- **Temperature outcome by 2100**: **+2.3°C**
- Policy ambitions are **partially and variably implemented** across regions
- Technology bottlenecks **ease but continue** to constrain deployment
- Grid improvements **approved and deployed** at a measured pace
- Energy security: **balanced independence**
- Economic growth: **~2.4%** consensus annual GDP growth
- This is the scenario used as the primary reference throughout the report

### Scenario 3: Sustainable Transformation
- **Temperature outcome by 2100**: **+1.9°C**
- Policy ambitions are **fully achieved** with ambitious targets
- Technology cost learning curves **doubled**; breakthroughs achieved
- Grid build-out proceeds **as needed**
- Energy security: **higher independence**
- Economic growth: **above 3.0%** annual GDP growth
- This is the most optimistic scenario but still falls short of the 1.5°C Paris pathway

**Key insight**: Even the most ambitious scenario (Sustainable Transformation) only reaches 1.9°C — the 1.5°C Paris target would require natural gas to fall to just ~960 billion cubic meters by 2050, compared to ~4,000 bcm today.

---

## Forces Shaping Energy in 2025

The report identifies several key forces reshaping energy dynamics at the start of 2025:

### 1. Geopolitical Uncertainty
Governments and policymakers are increasingly prioritizing **energy affordability and security** over strict adherence to Paris Agreement targets. The geopolitical volatility of the past few years — including the Russia-Ukraine conflict, ongoing Middle East tensions, and US-China competition — has fundamentally altered how energy security is viewed. Supply chain diversification and domestic energy production have risen to the top of policy agendas in most major economies.

### 2. Growing Energy Demand from Emerging Markets
A profound inequality defines the global energy system: **less than 45% of the global population consumes more than 80% of global energy**. The flip side — that more than 55% of people share less than 20% of global energy — means that economic development in the Global South will create enormous new demand pressure that renewables alone may struggle to meet in the near term.

### 3. New Demand Drivers: Data Centers and AI
The explosive growth of artificial intelligence and digital infrastructure is creating a **new, transformative demand center** that did not exist at meaningful scale just a few years ago. Data centers are emerging as one of the most significant new demand sources, particularly in the US and EU.

### 4. Equipment Costs and Supply Chain Pressure
Despite the long-run trend toward falling renewable costs, **equipment costs are rising** in the near term due to supply chain constraints, labor shortages, and input material price increases. This is temporarily slowing the expected cost decline trajectory for solar panels, wind turbines, and grid infrastructure — all of which are critical to the energy transition.

---

## Global Energy Demand: A World of Divergence

### The Inequality of Energy Consumption

The energy consumption gap between rich and poor nations is stark:

| Region/Country | Per Capita Energy (2024, GJ) |
|---|---|
| Qatar | 570 |
| United States | 214 |
| Japan | 90 |
| China | 75 |
| Brazil | 49 |
| Indonesia | 25 |
| India | 21 |
| Ethiopia | 12 |
| South Sudan | 2 |

This gap underscores why global energy demand will continue to grow even as developed economies plateau or decline. As living standards rise in lower-income countries, energy demand will follow — and the trajectory will be steep.

### Regional Demand Growth Rates (CAGR 2023–2050, Continued Momentum)

| Region | Annual Growth Rate |
|---|---|
| India | +2.0% |
| ASEAN | +1.2% |
| Africa | +1.0% |
| Middle East | +0.4% |
| Rest of World | +0.3% |
| Latin America | +0.3% |
| China | +0.2% |
| North America | 0.0% |
| OECD Asia-Pacific | -0.1% |
| OECD Europe | -1.1% |

Developed regions will see energy demand flatten or decline as efficiency improves and electrification deepens. The real growth story is in the developing world — particularly **India, ASEAN, and Africa**.

### India: The Energy Giant in the Making

India deserves special attention. Between 2025 and 2050 under Continued Momentum:
- Per capita GDP is expected to grow **+183%**, reaching **$7,063**
- Industrial energy demand will grow by **+102%**
- India's current per capita energy consumption is only **39% of China's current level**

In a striking sensitivity analysis, McKinsey finds that if India's per capita GDP were to match **China's current level**, global energy demand would increase by approximately **16%** — equivalent to adding another large economy's entire energy footprint to the world.

### ASEAN: The Next Industrial Surge
In ASEAN countries, industrial demand is expected to grow by **57%** and power demand by more than **50%** between now and 2050. As manufacturing shifts from China and supply chains diversify, Southeast Asia will absorb an outsized share of heavy industrial activity.

---

## The Data Center Explosion

One of the most striking findings in the 2025 report is the dramatic upward revision of data center energy demand forecasts:

- **Global data center power demand growth**: +17% per year (2022–2030)
- **US data center growth**: nearly +25% per year through 2030
- **US data center share of total power demand**:
  - 2022: **3%**
  - 2030: **14%**
  - 2040: **28%**
  - 2050: **28%**

Data centers will contribute approximately **4.5 thousand terawatt-hours** of incremental electricity demand between 2024 and 2050 under Continued Momentum — equivalent to the growth contribution of the entire transportation electrification sector.

This surge is driven by artificial intelligence training and inference, cloud computing, and the buildout of digital infrastructure across emerging markets. The energy intensity of AI workloads — particularly large language model training — is orders of magnitude higher than traditional data processing.

---

## Fossil Fuels: Persistent but Declining

Despite the energy transition, fossil fuels are projected to remain a **substantial share of the global energy mix** through 2050 across all three scenarios:

| Scenario | Fossil Fuel Share of Total Energy in 2050 |
|---|---|
| Slow Evolution | 55% |
| Continued Momentum | 49% |
| Sustainable Transformation | 41% |

This persistence reflects the deep structural role of fossil fuels in hard-to-abate sectors (aviation, shipping, high-temperature industrial heat, petrochemicals) and the challenges of building out clean alternatives at sufficient scale.

### Oil Demand

- **Current level**: ~100 million barrels per day (bbl/day)
- **Expected peak**: ~109 million bbl/day
- **2030 projection**: 103–109 million bbl/day
- **2050 projection**: 72–100 million bbl/day (wide range across scenarios)

Oil demand in road transport is declining as EV adoption accelerates, but **aviation, maritime, and petrochemicals** remain oil-intensive. The chemicals sector, in particular, continues to grow its share of oil demand even as transport shrinks.

**Supply side concern**: By 2040, the world will need **14 million bbl/day of new upstream developments** beyond currently sanctioned deepwater and shale projects. This reflects the ongoing decline of existing fields and the fact that even in a transition scenario, significant new oil investment is still required. OPEC and Middle Eastern producers' share of global supply is expected to **rise from 25% (2024) to 33% (2040)** as non-OPEC production declines.

### Natural Gas

- **Current level**: just over 4,000 billion cubic meters (bcm)
- **2050 projections**:
  - Slow Evolution: ~5,020 bcm (+25%)
  - Continued Momentum: ~4,550 bcm (+13%)
  - Sustainable Transformation: ~3,860 bcm (-4%)
  - 1.5°C pathway: ~960 bcm (-76%)

Natural gas remains a **critical transition fuel**, especially for power generation and industrial heat. The gap between the Sustainable Transformation scenario (~3,860 bcm) and the 1.5°C pathway (~960 bcm) is enormous, illustrating just how difficult the final stages of decarbonization will be.

### Coal

Coal demand tells a **tale of two worlds**:
- In developed regions (EU, US, UK, Germany, Poland), coal is in clear structural decline, with plant closures accelerating
- In developing Asia (China, India, Indonesia), coal remains central to power generation and steelmaking
- **80% of the global thermal coal market** is concentrated in just four regions: China, Southeast Asia, India, and South Africa
- **Metallurgical coal** (used in blast furnace steelmaking) is expected to see ~10% growth in the coming decade, driven by Southeast Asian blast furnace capacity expansion
- Coal power generation will decline globally but **persist through 2050** in many markets

---

## The Electricity Revolution

The most transformative trend across all scenarios is the rapid **electrification of the global economy**, with electricity growing faster than total energy demand.

### Total Electricity Demand Growth (2024–2050, Continued Momentum)

Total incremental electricity consumption: **+30.8 thousand terawatt-hours (TWh)**

By region:
- China: **+8.7k TWh** (largest contributor)
- Rest of World: **+5.9k TWh**
- North America: **+5.6k TWh**
- India: **+4.1k TWh**
- Africa: **+2.3k TWh**
- Europe: **+2.2k TWh**
- Asia-Pacific (OECD): **+2.0k TWh**

By sector:
- Industry: **+11.2k TWh** (largest driver — electric motors, electric heat, hydrogen production in industry)
- Buildings: **+5.9k TWh**
- Hydrogen production: **+4.7k TWh**
- Data centers: **+4.5k TWh**
- Transport: **+4.5k TWh**

### The Renewables Surge

Renewable energy — primarily solar and wind — will dominate new power generation capacity additions:

**Renewable share of global power mix:**

| Year | Slow Evolution | Continued Momentum | Sustainable Transformation |
|---|---|---|---|
| 2023 | 35% | 35% | 35% |
| 2030 | 45% | 46% | 47% |
| 2050 | 61% | 63% | 67% |

**Technology-level CAGR (2023–2050, Continued Momentum):**

| Technology | Annual Growth Rate |
|---|---|
| Solar (utility & distributed) | +9% |
| Offshore wind | +8% |
| Onshore wind | +7% |
| Hydropower | +1% |
| Clean, firm (nuclear + geothermal) | +4% |
| Gas power | +2% |
| Solid fuels (coal) | -4% |
| Other fossil | -12% |

### Power Sector CO2 Emissions

- **2023**: 10 gigatons of CO2
- **2030**: ~10 gigatons (similar across all scenarios — transition benefits not yet visible at scale)
- **2050**:
  - Slow Evolution: **6 gigatons**
  - Continued Momentum: **7 gigatons**
  - Sustainable Transformation: **3 gigatons**

---

## Regional Decarbonization: An Uneven Race

The report highlights dramatic **regional divergence** in the pace and depth of decarbonization:

### Low-Carbon Power Generation Targets by 2050

| Region | Low-Carbon Share of Power Mix |
|---|---|
| OECD Europe | **100%** |
| China | **92%** |
| India | **85%** |
| North America | **75%** |
| Middle East | **65%** |
| Non-OECD Asia | **61%** |

### Technology Deployment Gaps vs. 2030 Targets

Despite stated ambitions, many regions are significantly behind their own 2030 targets:

**Europe:**
- Renewables: **44%** of target achieved
- Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS): only **8%** of target (265 GW required)
- Low-carbon hydrogen: **76%** of target
- EVs: **48%** of target (17 million required)
- Nuclear: **100%** of target (on track at 109 GW)

**United States:**
- Renewables: **50%** of target (773 GW required)
- BESS: **77%** of target
- Low-carbon hydrogen: **48%** of target (300 MTPA)
- EVs: **105%** of target (10 million) — on track or slightly ahead
- Nuclear: **100%** (on track at 106 GW)

**China:**
- Renewables: **29%** of target (3,063 GW required — enormous scale)
- Nuclear: only **9%** of target (103 GW required — major gap)
- BESS: **50%** of target
- Low-carbon hydrogen: **91%** of target
- EVs: **155%** of target (45 million) — dramatically ahead of target

## The Economics of Decarbonization

### Abatement Costs: The Last Mile is Expensive

Decarbonizing the power sector becomes **exponentially more expensive** as you approach 100%:

| Decarbonization Level | Cost per Metric Ton of CO2 Abated |
|---|---|
| 45% to 70% | ~$20 |
| 70% to 95% | ~$50 |
| 95% to 100% | $90–$170 |

This "last mile" problem has profound policy implications: spending enormous resources to eliminate the final 5% of power sector emissions may deliver less climate benefit per dollar than deploying those same resources to decarbonize other sectors (transport, buildings, industry) that are still at early stages of their transition.

### Supply Chain Bottlenecks: The Hidden Constraint

One underappreciated challenge is the **dramatic lengthening of clean-energy equipment lead times** since 2019:

| Component | Global Lead Time (2019) | Global Lead Time (2023) | US Lead Time (2024) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Generators | 6–10 months | 10–16 months | 15–24 months |
| UPS (Uninterruptible Power Supply) | 6–10 months | 16–20 months | 9–15 months |
| Medium-voltage transformers | 4–16 months | 18–24 months | 15–24 months |

These bottlenecks reflect the gap between announced policy ambitions and the actual manufacturing capacity to deliver the hardware required. Grid transformers, in particular, have become a critical choke point for renewable energy deployment and data center buildout.

---

## Sensitivity Analysis: A 2027 Recession Scenario

McKinsey includes a striking stress test: what if a global recession hits in 2027?

Assumptions:
- **-2.5% global GDP contraction** in 2027
- Applied to the Continued Momentum base case

Results by 2035:
- **-6% GDP** (equivalent to -$7 trillion vs. baseline)
- **-4% final energy consumption** (-19.4 exajoules)
- Regional energy impact:
  - Greater China: **-8.0 EJ**
  - India: **-1.7 EJ**
  - North America: **-1.5 EJ**
  - Other regions: **-7.9 EJ**

A deep recession would slow the energy transition significantly — not because of policy rollbacks per se, but because capital investment in new projects dries up and demand for energy-intensive goods falls. The transition is, ultimately, dependent on sustained economic growth and investment.

---

## Key Conclusions and Takeaways

The report resists offering a single "correct" path, instead emphasizing several overarching conclusions:

### 1. Energy Demand Will Keep Growing
Global primary energy demand will **continue rising through at least 2050** in the Slow Evolution and Continued Momentum scenarios. The world is not yet past peak energy demand in aggregate — only specific regions (OECD Europe, North America) are declining, while the rest of the world continues to grow.

### 2. Fossil Fuels Are Not Going Away Anytime Soon
Even in the most optimistic scenario, fossil fuels remain **41% of global energy in 2050**. Complete phase-out before 2060 is not supported by the modeling. This is a critical reality check for energy policy: the transition is a matter of decades, not years.

### 3. Electrification Is the Master Trend
The common thread across all scenarios is **the rising share of electricity** in total energy consumption. Electricity is the medium through which renewables reach most end-use sectors. The sectors that can electrify most easily (road transport, buildings, light industry) will decarbonize first; the harder sectors will follow more slowly.

### 4. Emerging Markets Will Define the Outcome
India, ASEAN, Africa, and the Middle East will be the key battlegrounds for the global energy transition. If these regions industrialize primarily on fossil fuels (as today's developed nations did), the Paris targets are unachievable. But if they can leapfrog to clean energy at scale — supported by technology transfer and financing from wealthy nations — there is a more optimistic path.

### 5. Affordability Is the Decisive Variable
Across all scenarios, **energy affordability** emerges as the primary constraint on the pace of transition. Consumers and businesses in both developed and developing economies resist energy price increases, and governments face political consequences for imposing them. The energy transition will proceed at the speed that affordability allows — which is slower than many climate advocates hope for.

### 6. The Last 10% of Decarbonization Is Disproportionately Expensive
The cost curve for decarbonizing the power sector is highly **non-linear**: getting from 0% to 70% clean is relatively cheap; getting from 90% to 100% is enormously expensive. This suggests that a **systems-wide perspective** is critical — resources may deliver more climate benefit deployed in hard-to-abate sectors than chasing the final percentage points of power sector decarbonization.

### 7. Technology and Policy Must Work Together
No technology trend will independently drive the transition. Solar costs could fall further, but without grid upgrades, storage, and market design reforms, the power cannot be delivered. Policy ambition must be matched by practical infrastructure investment — supply chains, workforce training, permitting reform, and grid expansion.

## 3가지 시나리오 프레임워크

맥킨지는 서로 다른 에너지 전환 속도를 나타내는 **3가지 시나리오**를 중심으로 전망을 구성합니다.

### 시나리오 1: 느린 진화 (Slow Evolution)
- **2100년까지 기온 상승**: **+2.7°C**
- 정책 목표 **달성 실패**; 청정 기술 투자 감소
- 기술 병목 **해소되지 않음**; 학습 곡선 정체
- 전력망 구축 **지연**; 원자력은 규제로 제약
- 에너지 안보: **낮은 독립성**
- 경제 성장: 연간 GDP 성장률 **0.5% 미만**

### 시나리오 2: 지속적 모멘텀 (Continued Momentum) — 기준 시나리오
- **2100년까지 기온 상승**: **+2.3°C**
- 정책 목표 **부분적·지역별로 다르게 이행**
- 기술 병목 **완화되지만 지속**
- 전력망 개선 **승인 및 적정 속도로 구축**
- 에너지 안보: **균형 잡힌 독립성**
- 경제 성장: 연간 GDP 성장률 **~2.4%** (컨센서스)

### 시나리오 3: 지속가능 전환 (Sustainable Transformation)
- **2100년까지 기온 상승**: **+1.9°C**
- 정책 목표 **완전 달성**, 야심찬 목표 설정
- 기술 비용 학습 곡선 **2배 가속**; 기술 돌파구 달성
- 전력망 구축 **필요에 따라 신속히 진행**
- 에너지 안보: **높은 독립성**
- 경제 성장: 연간 GDP 성장률 **3.0% 이상**

**핵심 인사이트**: 가장 낙관적인 시나리오(지속가능 전환)도 **1.9°C**에 머무릅니다. 파리협정의 1.5°C 목표를 달성하려면 천연가스가 현재 약 4,000 bcm에서 2050년 ~960 bcm으로 급감해야 하는데, 이는 현실적으로 극히 어려운 수준입니다.

---

## 2025년 에너지를 형성하는 힘

### 1. 지정학적 불확실성
각국 정부와 정책 입안자들은 파리협정 목표 이행보다 **에너지 저렴성과 안보**를 우선시하는 경향이 강해지고 있습니다. 러시아-우크라이나 분쟁, 중동 긴장, 미·중 경쟁 등으로 공급망 다각화와 자국 내 에너지 생산이 정책 최우선 과제로 부상했습니다.

### 2. 신흥국의 에너지 수요 폭발
전 세계 인구의 **45% 미만이 전체 에너지의 80% 이상을 소비**한다는 극심한 불평등이 글로벌 에너지 시스템을 특징 짓습니다. 개발도상국의 경제 발전은 단기적으로 재생에너지만으로 충족하기 어려운 엄청난 신규 수요를 창출할 것입니다.

### 3. 새로운 수요 동인: 데이터센터와 AI
AI와 디지털 인프라의 폭발적 성장이 불과 몇 년 전까지만 해도 존재하지 않았던 **새로운 대형 수요 센터**를 만들어내고 있습니다.

### 4. 설비 비용과 공급망 압박
재생에너지의 장기적 비용 하락 추세에도 불구하고, 공급망 제약과 원자재 가격 상승으로 **단기적으로는 설비 비용이 상승**하고 있습니다. 이는 태양광 패널, 풍력 터빈, 전력망 인프라의 예상 비용 하락 경로를 일시적으로 지연시키고 있습니다.

---

## 글로벌 에너지 수요: 격차의 세계

### 에너지 소비의 불평등

전 세계 에너지 소비의 불평등은 극심합니다:

| 국가/지역 | 1인당 에너지 소비량 (2024, GJ) |
|---|---|
| 카타르 | 570 |
| 미국 | 214 |
| 일본 | 90 |
| 중국 | 75 |
| 브라질 | 49 |
| 인도네시아 | 25 |
| 인도 | 21 |
| 에티오피아 | 12 |
| 남수단 | 2 |

이 격차는 저소득 국가에서 생활 수준이 향상되면 에너지 수요가 급증할 것임을 의미합니다.

### 지역별 수요 성장률 (2023–2050 CAGR, 지속적 모멘텀)

| 지역 | 연평균 성장률 |
|---|---|
| 인도 | +2.0% |
| 아세안 | +1.2% |
| 아프리카 | +1.0% |
| 중동 | +0.4% |
| 기타 세계 | +0.3% |
| 라틴아메리카 | +0.3% |
| 중국 | +0.2% |
| 북미 | 0.0% |
| OECD 아시아-태평양 | -0.1% |
| OECD 유럽 | -1.1% |

선진국 지역은 효율 향상과 전동화 심화로 에너지 수요가 정체 또는 감소하겠지만, 진정한 성장 이야기는 개발도상국, 특히 **인도·아세안·아프리카**에 있습니다.

### 인도: 떠오르는 에너지 거인

- 2025~2050년 1인당 GDP **+183% 성장** 전망, 1인당 GDP **$7,063** 도달
- 산업 에너지 수요 **+102% 성장**
- 현재 인도의 1인당 에너지 소비량은 **중국의 현재 수준의 39%**에 불과

맥킨지의 민감도 분석에 따르면, 만약 인도의 1인당 GDP가 **중국의 현재 수준에 도달**한다면 전 세계 에너지 수요가 약 **16% 증가**할 것으로 추정됩니다 — 이는 대형 경제권 하나의 총 에너지 소비량을 추가하는 것과 맞먹습니다.

### 아세안: 다음 산업 폭발
아세안 국가에서는 2050년까지 산업 에너지 수요가 **57%**, 전력 수요가 **50% 이상** 증가할 것으로 예상됩니다.

---

## 데이터센터 폭발: 새로운 수요 혁명

2025년 보고서의 가장 주목할 만한 발견 중 하나는 데이터센터 에너지 수요 예측의 대폭 상향 조정입니다:

- **글로벌 데이터센터 전력 수요 성장**: 연간 +**17%** (2022–2030)
- **미국 데이터센터 성장**: 2030년까지 연간 +**25%**
- **미국 전체 전력 수요 중 데이터센터 비중**:
  - 2022년: **3%**
  - 2030년: **14%**
  - 2040년: **28%**
  - 2050년: **28%**

데이터센터는 지속적 모멘텀 시나리오에서 2024~2050년 사이 약 **4.5천 TWh**의 추가 전력 수요를 창출할 것으로 예상됩니다 — 교통 전동화 전체와 맞먹는 규모입니다. AI 대형 언어 모델 훈련의 에너지 강도는 기존 데이터 처리보다 훨씬 높아, 수요 충격이 예상을 초과할 가능성도 있습니다.

---

## 화석 연료: 완강한 지속

에너지 전환에도 불구하고, 화석 연료는 **모든 시나리오에서 2050년까지 글로벌 에너지 믹스의 상당 부분**을 차지할 것으로 전망됩니다:

| 시나리오 | 2050년 화석연료 비중 |
|---|---|
| 느린 진화 | 55% |
| 지속적 모멘텀 | 49% |
| 지속가능 전환 | 41% |

이러한 지속성은 항공·해운·고온 산업 열·석유화학 등 탈탄소화가 어려운 부문에서의 화석 연료의 구조적 역할과 충분한 규모의 청정 대안 구축의 어려움을 반영합니다.

### 석유 수요

- **현재 수준**: ~1억 bbl/day
- **예상 피크**: ~1억 900만 bbl/day
- **2050년 전망**: 7,200만~1억 bbl/day (시나리오별 큰 차이)
- **공급 측 우려**: 2040년까지 현재 승인된 심해·셰일 프로젝트 외에 **1,400만 bbl/day의 신규 상류 개발** 필요. OPEC 및 중동 산유국의 글로벌 공급 비중은 2024년 25%에서 2040년 **33%로 상승** 전망

### 천연가스

- **현재 수준**: 약 4,000 bcm
- **2050년 전망**:
  - 느린 진화: ~5,020 bcm
  - 지속적 모멘텀: ~4,550 bcm
  - 지속가능 전환: ~3,860 bcm
  - 1.5°C 경로: ~960 bcm (현재 대비 -76%)

### 석탄

## 탈탄소화의 경제학

### 감축 비용: 마지막 1%가 가장 비싸다

| 탈탄소화 수준 | CO2 1톤당 감축 비용 |
|---|---|
| 45%→70% | ~$20 |
| 70%→95% | ~$50 |
| 95%→100% | $90–$170 |

이 '마지막 구간' 문제는 중요한 정책적 함의를 가집니다: 전력 부문의 마지막 5% 탄소를 없애는 데 막대한 자원을 투입하는 것보다, 그 자원을 교통·건물·산업 등 아직 전환 초기 단계인 부문에 배치하는 것이 기후 혜택 대비 비용 효율이 더 높을 수 있습니다.

### 공급망 병목: 숨겨진 제약

청정 에너지 설비 리드 타임이 2019년 이후 극적으로 늘어났습니다:

| 부품 | 글로벌 리드 타임 (2019) | 글로벌 리드 타임 (2023) | 미국 리드 타임 (2024) |
|---|---|---|---|
| 발전기 | 6–10개월 | 10–16개월 | 15–24개월 |
| UPS (무정전 전원장치) | 6–10개월 | 16–20개월 | 9–15개월 |
| 중압 변압기 | 4–16개월 | 18–24개월 | 15–24개월 |

전력망 변압기는 재생에너지 배치와 데이터센터 구축의 핵심 병목으로 부상했습니다.

## 2027년 경기침체 민감도 분석

만약 2027년에 글로벌 경기침체가 발생한다면?

- **가정**: 글로벌 GDP **-2.5% 수축** (2027년)
- **2035년까지 결과**:
  - GDP **-6%** (-7조 달러)
  - 최종 에너지 소비 **-4%** (-19.4 EJ)
- 지역별 에너지 영향:
  - 중국: **-8.0 EJ**
  - 인도: **-1.7 EJ**
  - 북미: **-1.5 EJ**
  - 기타: **-7.9 EJ**

경기침체는 정책 철회보다 **투자 자본 감소와 에너지 집약적 상품 수요 감소**를 통해 에너지 전환을 크게 늦출 것입니다.

## 핵심 결론

### 1. 에너지 수요는 계속 성장한다
글로벌 1차 에너지 수요는 느린 진화 및 지속적 모멘텀 시나리오에서 **최소 2050년까지 계속 증가**합니다. 세계는 아직 총 에너지 수요의 피크를 지나지 않았습니다.

### 2. 화석 연료는 빠르게 사라지지 않는다
가장 낙관적인 시나리오에서도 화석 연료는 **2050년 글로벌 에너지의 41%**를 차지합니다. 2060년 이전의 완전한 단계적 폐지는 모델링에서 지지되지 않습니다.

### 3. 전동화가 핵심 트렌드다
모든 시나리오를 관통하는 공통 실은 **총 에너지 소비에서 전력의 비중 증가**입니다. 쉽게 전동화할 수 있는 부문(도로 교통, 건물, 경공업)이 먼저 탈탄소화되고, 어려운 부문은 더 느리게 뒤따를 것입니다.

### 4. 신흥국이 결과를 결정한다
인도·아세안·아프리카·중동이 글로벌 에너지 전환의 핵심 전쟁터가 될 것입니다. 이 지역들이 화석 연료 중심으로 산업화를 추진한다면 파리 목표는 달성 불가능합니다.

### 5. 저렴성이 결정적 변수다
모든 시나리오에서 **에너지 저렴성**이 전환 속도의 핵심 제약으로 부상합니다. 소비자와 기업은 에너지 가격 상승에 저항하고, 정부는 이를 강요할 때 정치적 대가를 치릅니다.

### 6. 마지막 10% 탈탄소화는 불균형적으로 비싸다
전력 부문의 탈탄소화 비용 곡선은 매우 **비선형적**입니다. 70%까지는 비교적 저렴하지만 90%에서 100%로 가는 구간은 엄청나게 비쌉니다. **시스템 전체 관점**이 중요한 이유입니다.

### 7. 기술과 정책이 함께 움직여야 한다
어떤 기술 트렌드도 단독으로 전환을 이끌 수 없습니다. 태양광 비용이 아무리 낮아져도 전력망 업그레이드, 저장장치, 시장 설계 개혁 없이는 전력을 전달할 수 없습니다.
