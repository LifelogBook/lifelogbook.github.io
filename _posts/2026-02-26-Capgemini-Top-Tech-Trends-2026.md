## Part 1: English Summary

### Report Overview

**Publisher**: Capgemini (TechnoVision Program)
**Title**: Top Tech Trends of 2026
**Pages**: 32
**Focus**: Four major technology trends reshaping enterprise strategy in 2026, plus emerging signals to watch through 2030 and beyond

The **Capgemini Top Tech Trends of 2026** report identifies the forces that will most significantly reshape enterprise technology this year. Published under Capgemini's ongoing **TechnoVision** program, the report covers four interconnected trends — AI transforming software engineering, the rise of intelligent operations, the multi-cloud revolution (Cloud 3.0), and technological sovereignty — as well as a forward-looking section on materials science and quantum-era computing. The concluding message is that "transformative change occurs when multiple technologies converge seamlessly to address complex challenges," and that organizations which harness this borderless, intelligent future will not only lead in 2026 but also shape the foundation for the decade ahead.

### Trend 1: AI Transforms Software Engineering

#### Background

Generative AI has moved from a novelty for individual developers into a structural force reshaping how software is designed, built, tested, and maintained. Capgemini's own research — captured in its "Turbocharging Software with Gen AI" series — documents the acceleration now visible across the full development lifecycle. The key inflection point in 2026 is the shift from **AI-assisted** development (where AI helps individual developers complete tasks faster) to **agentic development** (where AI systems autonomously plan, execute, test, and iterate on code with minimal human intervention).

#### Key Developments

The productivity impact is substantial. AI coding copilots are now embedded in major development environments, enabling engineers to offload repetitive code generation, boilerplate writing, and unit test creation to AI. More significantly, agentic AI systems are beginning to handle multi-step software tasks: generating initial implementations from natural-language requirements, running automated tests, identifying failures, proposing fixes, and iterating — all within a single orchestrated loop.

Gartner projects that **40% of enterprise applications will feature task-specific AI agents by 2026**, up from less than 5% in 2025. This dramatic jump reflects both the rapid maturation of agentic frameworks and the pressure on engineering teams to increase throughput without proportionally increasing headcount.

Code review, documentation generation, security scanning, and deployment pipeline optimization are all areas where GenAI is delivering measurable ROI. Organizations that invest in integrating AI deeply into their software supply chain — not merely as a developer tool but as an automated collaborator across the entire delivery process — are pulling ahead in release velocity and code quality.

#### What This Means for Organizations

The challenge for enterprises is governance: how to capture AI-driven productivity while maintaining code quality, security, and compliance. "AI-first" development teams are rewriting their workflows, adopting AI-native IDEs, and upskilling engineers to supervise and steer autonomous agents rather than write every line manually. The organizations that get this balance right will be able to ship higher-quality software faster, with smaller teams — gaining a durable structural advantage over those still relying on traditional development workflows.

### Trend 2: The Rise of Intelligent Operations

#### Background

Across finance, supply chain, procurement, HR, and customer service, AI is reshaping what it means to "run operations." For years, digital transformation focused on automating repetitive tasks and building dashboards that report on what has already happened. The 2026 frontier is fundamentally different: **AI-operated systems** where automation goes beyond reporting and isolated task execution into active decision-making and end-to-end process orchestration.

#### The Shift from Dashboards to Command Centers

The most visible signal of this trend is the transformation of the **operational command center**. Traditional command centers were passive monitoring hubs — they showed metrics and alerted humans when thresholds were breached. Today, AI-powered command centers are becoming active participants in operations. AI suggests the next best action, executes routine steps autonomously, and escalates only when the situation requires human judgment.

Early pilots are already demonstrating the impact. In finance and accounting, AI systems are handling **month-end close procedures** — reconciling accounts, flagging discrepancies, and generating draft reports — that previously required intensive manual effort. In procurement and vendor management, AI is conducting **vendor risk checks**, monitoring contract compliance, and recommending supplier decisions. These are not simple rule-based automations; they involve multi-step reasoning, data synthesis, and judgment calls at a level previously requiring experienced human professionals.

The result, as Capgemini's CTInO Manuel Sevilla observes, is that "operations are no longer static systems optimized once and maintained over time. They are becoming intelligent, adaptive cores — where AI is embedded into processes and humans co-steer systems that learn and evolve continuously."

#### Human-AI Co-Steering

A defining feature of intelligent operations in 2026 is the concept of **human-AI co-steering**. This is not AI replacing human operators; it is AI and humans collaborating in a structured division of labor. AI handles high-volume, time-sensitive, rule-bound decisions at machine speed. Humans focus on exceptions, judgment calls, strategic interventions, and the oversight required to ensure the AI's decisions remain aligned with organizational goals.

This model frees up human talent from the endless cycle of routine operational tasks and directs their attention toward the work that genuinely requires human insight: managing customer escalations, negotiating with suppliers, responding to novel risks, and steering the AI systems themselves. The practical effect is a significant increase in the effective capacity of operations teams — without a proportional increase in headcount.

#### Beyond Cost Reduction

Capgemini is explicit that the real story behind intelligent operations is not just cost savings. The deeper opportunity is the ability to **unlock new value streams** and **transform operations into a genuine growth engine**. When operations teams are no longer consumed by high-volume routine work, they can invest their time in identifying inefficiencies, designing process improvements, and developing new service capabilities. Operations become not just a back-office cost center but a strategic differentiator.

The trajectory is clear: operations are shifting from fragmented, siloed workflows to adaptive, AI-operated systems. Organizations that embrace this shift proactively — investing in AI infrastructure, governance frameworks, and human-AI collaboration models — will move faster, serve customers better, and extract more value from their operations than those that continue to manage by exception from a passive dashboard.

### Trend 3: Cloud 3.0 — All Flavors of Cloud

#### The Next Evolution of Cloud

Cloud computing is entering its third major phase. The first phase was **migration**: moving workloads from on-premises data centers to public cloud infrastructure. The second phase was **optimization**: right-sizing cloud usage, reducing costs, and modernizing applications. The third phase — **Cloud 3.0** — is fundamentally different in character. Cloud is no longer primarily an IT infrastructure choice; it is becoming the **execution backbone for AI and AI-operated applications**.

The scale of this shift is reflected in the numbers. **Public cloud spending is expected to almost double, from $723 billion in 2025 to $1.47 trillion by 2029.** Generative AI alone is projected to account for **10 to 15% of that total spend by the end of the decade**. Cloud value is no longer defined solely by elasticity and cost efficiency; it is defined by the ability to sustain **AI-intensive, always-on workloads** at scale and with low latency.

#### Why Classical Cloud Architecture Is No Longer Sufficient

The infrastructure requirements of AI — and especially **agentic AI** — expose a fundamental limitation of classical public cloud architectures. Running AI at scale requires the ability to:

- **Fine-tune models on proprietary data** without exposing that data to shared cloud environments
- **Control data sensitivity and residency** to meet regulatory requirements
- **Deliver low-latency inference** at the edge, close to where data is generated and consumed
- **Operate distributed, multi-agent systems** that span organizational and geographic boundaries

No single public cloud provider can satisfy all of these requirements simultaneously. The result is an accelerating push toward **hybrid, private, multi-cloud, and sovereign cloud architectures** — not as edge cases for unusually complex workloads, but as the new operational norm for enterprises across industries.

Agentic systems, in particular, require a scalable, distributed, low-latency infrastructure where cloud and edge operate as a **single intelligent fabric**. The model of routing all workloads to one centralized hyperscaler is giving way to a more nuanced approach: workloads are placed where they are best served — at the edge for latency-sensitive inference, in private or sovereign environments for regulated or sensitive processing, and in public cloud for scalable compute-intensive training tasks.

#### Two Structural Pressures Driving the Shift

Beyond AI requirements, two structural forces are reshaping cloud strategy:

**First**, high-profile cloud outages have exposed the risk of **single-provider dependence**. Major public cloud failures can bring down large portions of the global digital economy simultaneously. Enterprises are increasingly designing for portability and resilience — ensuring that critical applications can continue to function even if one cloud provider experiences a significant outage.

**Second**, escalating **geopolitical tensions and data sovereignty requirements** are reshaping cloud choices. Organizations — particularly in regulated industries and jurisdictions with strict data residency rules — are seeking greater control over where data resides and how workloads are executed. Regulatory pressure mandates that certain data must never leave specific jurisdictions, which classical global hyperscaler architectures often cannot accommodate without special sovereign arrangements.

#### What Cloud 3.0 Looks Like in 2026

By 2026, **hybrid platforms are becoming mainstream**. AI workloads flow seamlessly between edge, private cloud, and public cloud environments. Organizations are redesigning their architectures not just for cost optimization, but for **resilience, interoperability, and strategic autonomy**. Cloud 3.0 marks the moment when cloud stops being only an IT platform and becomes the distributed execution layer that makes AI — especially agentic AI — possible at scale.

For enterprises, this transformation changes the operating model fundamentally. The job is no longer managing a centralized cloud platform but **orchestrating a continuously evolving, distributed computing fabric**. This requires new skills, new governance frameworks, and a product-thinking approach to infrastructure — ensuring service continuity, deploying AI workloads safely across heterogeneous environments, and maintaining strategic flexibility across clouds and edges simultaneously.

**Three key signals that Cloud 3.0 has arrived:**

**Signal 1 — AI-optimized hybrid architectures**: Enterprises are deliberately splitting AI workloads across environments based on the requirements of each workload. Fine-tuning of models runs in controlled private cloud environments where proprietary data remains protected; inference executes at the edge where latency is critical. This architectural separation is not ad hoc but intentional and systematic.

**Signal 2 — Multi-cloud portability frameworks**: Enterprises are running critical applications on two or more cloud providers simultaneously — not primarily for cost reasons but for resilience and sovereignty. Containerized AI services, cloud-agnostic data layers, and replicated inference stacks are deployed across providers to eliminate single points of failure and ensure workload continuity regardless of provider-level disruptions.

**Signal 3 — Sovereign cloud regions and overlays**: Financial services, public sector, and healthcare organizations are leading pilots that combine hyperscaler scale with strict locality controls, audited administration, and independent cryptographic governance. These sovereign arrangements allow regulated workloads to operate on globally scalable infrastructure while satisfying jurisdictional requirements that would otherwise prohibit public cloud deployment.

As Eric Fradet, CTO and Head of Industrialization of Cloud Infrastructure Services at Capgemini, observes: "Cloud is entering a new phase, driven by the need to provide the intelligent fabric required to run AI workloads and orchestrate agentic systems. This future cloud is inherently multi-faceted, spanning multi-cloud, hybrid, and edge environments operating as a single continuum."

#### Why It Matters

Cloud 3.0 increases resilience but also introduces complexity. The differentiator is no longer choosing the best single platform; it is **mastering interoperability, portability, and intelligent workload placement** across a diverse, distributed technology estate. Organizations that develop this capability will operate AI at scale with confidence; those that remain locked into a single provider will face growing exposure as AI workloads grow in sensitivity, volume, and strategic importance.

Cloud providers themselves face higher expectations: agility regarding multi-vendor flexibility, sovereign deployment options, cross-cloud compatibility, and seamless edge-to-cloud integration — all while meeting the performance demands of generative AI and agentic workloads. Providers that deliver openness and resilience, rather than lock-in, will define the next phase of the market.

### Trend 4: The Borderless Paradox of Technological Sovereignty

#### The Return of Sovereignty

**Technological sovereignty** has returned to the top of the strategic agenda — at levels not seen since the COVID-19 crisis. Escalating tensions around critical supply chains, renewed scrutiny of data and cloud dependencies, and growing concern over AI infrastructure control have pushed sovereignty from a policy aspiration to a board-level strategic priority. Governments, regulators, and enterprise leaders are simultaneously recognizing how deeply their operations depend on global technology ecosystems they do not control.

The paradox at the core of this trend is stark: we live in a world built on **inherently borderless technologies**, yet the strategic imperative of the moment is for nations and organizations to achieve greater control over exactly those technologies. Modern digital systems depend on semiconductors from a small number of manufacturing locations, cloud platforms from a handful of hyperscalers, open-source frameworks from globally distributed communities, and frontier AI models from a tiny number of research laboratories. In this context, complete technological autonomy is not merely difficult — it is an illusion.

#### Redefining Sovereignty: From Isolation to Resilient Interdependence

The definition of "sovereignty" is far from settled. Does it mean localizing data? Operating domestic cloud infrastructure? Building indigenous chips? Mandating open-source alternatives? Reducing dependence on foreign AI models? Each of these is a real policy choice, and different governments and industries are reaching different conclusions.

What is emerging as consensus, however, is a new understanding: **sovereignty is no longer defined by isolation but by resilient interdependence**. The goal is not to disengage from global technology ecosystems; doing so would forfeit the innovation, scale, and competitiveness that those ecosystems provide. Instead, the goal is to ensure that critical operations cannot be disrupted by sanctions, geopolitical shocks, supply-chain failures, or decisions made by non-sovereign actors.

**Resilience**, in this context, means the ability to guarantee secure access to data, infrastructure, and talent regardless of external events — not the ability to operate in complete independence from the global technology supply chain. This is a significant reframing: sovereignty becomes a question of managing exposure and diversifying dependencies, rather than eliminating them.

#### The Corporate and Government Response

Governments and enterprises are accelerating investment not in full decoupling but in **credible alternatives that meaningfully reduce dependency risks**. Regional cloud providers, sovereign cloud offerings, domestic chip initiatives, and open-AI ecosystems are gaining momentum. Critically, all major hyperscalers have now launched or announced **sovereign and regulated cloud offerings for 2026**, reflecting a structural market shift toward **sovereignty-by-design** as a baseline expectation rather than a premium option.

These sovereign offerings do not replace global platforms. They complement them by strengthening negotiation power, increasing strategic flexibility, and reducing operational fragility for workloads where data residency, administrative access, or regulatory compliance demand jurisdictional control.

New architectural principles are emerging across enterprises: diversifying suppliers, adopting multi-cloud and multi-vendor strategies, maintaining data portability, and designing systems to withstand regulatory shifts or supply-chain disruptions without interrupting operations. **Sovereignty is becoming a design choice**, embedded into cloud strategy, data management, and AI deployment from the outset — rather than a retrofit applied after a crisis has already exposed the vulnerability.

#### Three Signals to Watch in 2026

**Signal 1 — Sovereign cloud and data-control architectures**: Enterprises are moving sensitive workloads to region-governed cloud zones or sovereign overlays, where administration, encryption, and data locality remain under local jurisdictional control. In regulated sectors — financial services, healthcare, public services, defense — AI inference and critical data pipelines are increasingly running inside sovereign environments rather than defaulting to globally managed hyperscaler infrastructure. When this pattern becomes visible at scale, sovereignty has moved from strategy to execution.

**Signal 2 — Sovereign AI ecosystems**: Governments and industries are developing locally governed **foundational models**, national training datasets, and sector-specific AI baselines. These initiatives ensure that high-risk AI workloads — including public services delivery, clinical decision support, financial risk management, and defense applications — do not depend solely on foreign black-box models whose training data, decision logic, and update cycles lie outside the organization's or nation's control. The adoption of "trusted AI stacks" with clear provenance, auditability, and jurisdictional guarantees marks the transition from aspiration to practice.

**Signal 3 — Domestic compute and resilient supply-chain programs**: Nations and large organizations are investing in chip fabrication capacity, advanced packaging, sovereign GPU clusters, and hardware supplier diversification. These programs aim to reduce vulnerability to export controls, sanctions, or geopolitical disruptions in semiconductor supply. At the enterprise level, procurement decisions and workload architecture choices are increasingly informed by sovereignty risk assessments — a signal that the transition from dependency to managed interdependence is well underway.

Together, these three signals show that sovereignty is expanding simultaneously across every critical layer of the technology stack: compute, cloud infrastructure, AI models, and supply chain. The organizations that build sovereignty into their architecture proactively will be better positioned for the geopolitical and regulatory environment of the late 2020s than those that wait for a disruption to force the issue.

As Nicolas Gaudillière, CTO of Capgemini Invent France, states: "Technology sovereignty is no longer a policy abstraction. It has become a strategic concern not only for nations, but for organizations as well. The conversation is shifting from the illusion of isolation to the practical challenge of managing interdependence and achieving strategic autonomy."

### Emerging Signals to Watch by 2030 and Beyond

#### The Next Frontier: Computing at the Molecular Scale

While the four main trends focus on the near-term technology landscape of 2026, Capgemini identifies a set of **emerging signals** that will shape the decade ahead. These signals originate not in digital interfaces or consumer platforms but in advances in the ability to **compute, model, and engineer the physical world at the atomic and molecular scale**.

Many of the hardest scientific and industrial challenges facing organizations today — from materials degradation and battery stability to catalytic efficiency and semiconductor reliability — are governed by quantum-mechanical effects that classical engineering methods can only approximate. A new generation of computational capabilities is changing this equation: **high-performance computing (HPC), AI and foundation models for science, and increasingly automated laboratories** are enabling far more precise exploration of complex physical systems than was previously possible.

Progress in quantum hardware and quantum-inspired algorithms is expected to further extend these capabilities as the decade advances. Together, these technologies are shifting materials innovation away from **empirical trial-and-error** toward **modelling and design grounded in first principles** — a transition with far-reaching implications for industries that depend on materials at their limits.

#### Signal 1: Materials Defined by Quantum Behavior

The next wave of materials innovation will be driven by a deeper understanding of matter at the atomic scale. As technologies push materials to their performance limits, **durability, reliability, and functional properties** are increasingly determined by quantum-scale effects that classical engineering approaches struggle to capture accurately. Many long-standing industrial challenges — including corrosion, degradation under operating stress, and failure under extreme conditions — originate at this level and cannot be fully addressed without understanding the underlying quantum behavior.

The combination of HPC, AI-driven modelling, and emerging quantum techniques is allowing scientists and engineers to **observe, simulate, and predict material behavior** with far greater accuracy than empirical testing alone can achieve. This makes it possible to design materials based not on simplified assumptions about macroscopic properties, but on how they actually behave in complex, dynamic, real-world environments.

The impact is twofold. First, it opens the door to entirely new classes of materials with breakthrough properties — including advanced batteries with higher energy density and longer cycle life, catalysts with greater efficiency and selectivity, novel electronic materials, and superconducting materials for next-generation computing. Second, it enables these innovations to be engineered deliberately for stability, manufacturability, and long-term reliability — not just discovered and empirically validated.

#### Signal 2: Next-Generation Biodegradability

A second emerging signal is the growing ability to **understand and model how materials degrade** at the atomic and molecular level. Biodegradability has traditionally been treated as an approximate, empirically assessed property — often achieved at the cost of performance, consistency, or predictability. Material degradation under real environmental conditions has remained difficult to control or design with precision, leaving industries to manage end-of-life impacts reactively rather than by design.

Advances in computation are beginning to change this. HPC, AI-driven models, and quantum computing are making it possible to simulate the chemical and physical processes that govern how materials interact with their environment and break down over time — from hydrolysis and oxidation to microbial interactions and photodegradation. This deeper understanding allows engineers to **design degradation pathways intentionally**, rather than discovering them after the fact through years of field testing.

Over the long term, this capability could fundamentally reshape sustainable materials design. Instead of retrofitting biodegradability after performance has been optimized — or accepting a trade-off between durability and environmental responsibility — future materials can be **engineered from the outset** to balance performance, durability, and controlled end-of-life behavior. This has significant implications for industries facing mounting sustainability requirements and regulatory pressure, from packaging and textiles to biomedical devices and electronics.

#### Signal 3: Synthetic Material Science

The third emerging frontier is the shift from **discovering materials to deliberately designing them**. Rather than searching for useful materials in nature or through empirical experimentation, scientists and engineers are increasingly able to define the properties they want — such as specific levels of electrical conductivity, mechanical strength, thermal resistance, or chemical reactivity — and engineer materials to match those requirements from first principles. Materials begin to resemble engineered systems: shaped by intent rather than by chance.

This shift is enabled by advances in both computation and laboratory automation. **AI-driven models combined with increasingly automated and autonomous laboratories** allow researchers to explore vast numbers of possible material combinations far more rapidly than traditional experimental methods permit. Data-driven design loops can rapidly test, refine, and validate new material candidates — compressing what once required years of experimentation into cycles of weeks or months.

Over time, these capabilities are becoming more broadly accessible. Cloud-based computational tools, shared research infrastructure, and more autonomous design systems are **lowering the barriers to entry**, extending advanced materials engineering beyond the small number of elite research institutions and large corporate R&D labs that have historically dominated the field. The result is a broad democratization and acceleration of materials innovation, with potential implications across mobility, energy storage, semiconductor manufacturing, construction, healthcare, and environmental remediation.

#### What This Means for the Decade Ahead

Taken together, these three signals represent a convergence of **advanced computation, chemistry, and biology** that is beginning to give technologists and scientists far greater control over the physical world than previous generations could achieve. AI, HPC, and laboratory automation are already reshaping how matter can be explored and engineered; quantum computing is expected to further extend these capabilities as hardware matures and algorithms improve.

The impact will not materialize as a single sudden disruption but as a **deeper transformation of the materials, components, and physical systems** on which all industries ultimately depend. Organizations that recognize this convergence will be better positioned to anticipate long-term technological change, manage emerging resource and sovereignty constraints, and build durable advantages in a world where **control over matter itself is becoming a strategic capability** — one that complements and ultimately underpins the AI, cloud, and sovereignty trends dominating the near-term agenda.

### Conclusion

The Capgemini Top Tech Trends of 2026 report paints a consistent and interconnected picture: the technology landscape in 2026 is defined by the **maturation and systemic integration of AI** — not just as a productivity tool for individual users, but as a structural force simultaneously reshaping software engineering, business operations, infrastructure architecture, and geopolitical strategy.

Four imperatives emerge as essential for enterprise leaders navigating this landscape:

1. **AI in software**: move from AI-assisted to agentic development; restructure engineering workflows and governance around AI collaboration and human oversight
2. **Intelligent operations**: build human-AI co-steering capabilities; transform operations from passive cost centers into adaptive, AI-operated growth engines
3. **Cloud 3.0**: master multi-cloud, hybrid, and edge architectures; design for AI workloads, resilience, and data sovereignty simultaneously
4. **Technological sovereignty**: embed sovereignty-by-design into cloud, data, and AI strategies; pursue resilient interdependence rather than the illusion of isolation

And looking further ahead, the report signals that the next competitive frontier will reach down to the physical layer — to materials, molecules, and the quantum-mechanical foundations of the technologies on which everything else depends.

Organizations that can integrate these four near-term trends while watching the longer-term horizon will not merely survive this wave of technological change: they will use it to redefine what is possible in their industries, their operations, and their competitive position.

## Part 2: 한국어 요약

### 보고서 개요

**출판사**: Capgemini (TechnoVision 프로그램)
**제목**: Top Tech Trends of 2026 (2026년 주요 기술 트렌드)
**페이지**: 32페이지
**주제**: 2026년 기업 전략을 재편할 4가지 주요 기술 트렌드 + 2030년 이후를 위한 신호 포착

Capgemini의 2026년 기술 트렌드 보고서는 AI의 소프트웨어 통합, 지능형 운영, 멀티클라우드 혁명(Cloud 3.0), 기술 주권이라는 네 가지 상호 연결된 트렌드를 다루며, 소재 과학과 양자 시대 컴퓨팅에 대한 장기 전망도 포함한다. 핵심 메시지: "복수의 기술이 원활하게 수렴할 때 진정한 변혁이 일어난다."

---

### 트렌드 1: AI가 소프트웨어 엔지니어링을 변혁하다

생성형 AI(GenAI)가 개인 개발자의 보조 도구에서 소프트웨어 개발 전 과정을 구조적으로 재편하는 핵심 동력으로 진화하고 있다. 2026년의 변곡점은 **AI 보조 개발**(AI가 개별 작업 속도를 높이는 수준)에서 **에이전틱 개발**(AI 시스템이 코드 작성·테스트·반복 수정을 자율적으로 오케스트레이션)로의 전환이다.

Gartner는 **2026년까지 기업 애플리케이션의 40%가 업무별 AI 에이전트를 탑재**할 것으로 예측한다(2025년 5% 미만 대비 급격한 증가). AI 코딩 코파일럿은 주요 개발 환경에 이미 내장되어 있으며, 코드 리뷰·문서 자동 생성·보안 스캐닝·배포 파이프라인 최적화 전 영역에서 측정 가능한 ROI를 제공하고 있다.

기업의 핵심 과제는 **거버넌스**: AI 주도 생산성을 극대화하면서 코드 품질·보안·규정 준수를 유지하는 균형점 찾기. "AI 퍼스트" 개발팀은 모든 코드를 직접 작성하는 대신, 자율 에이전트를 감독하고 방향을 이끄는 새로운 역할로 전환하고 있다. 이 균형을 먼저 찾은 조직은 더 작은 팀으로 더 빠르게, 더 높은 품질의 소프트웨어를 출시하는 구조적 우위를 갖게 된다.

---

### 트렌드 2: 지능형 운영의 부상

재무, 공급망, 조달, HR, 고객 서비스 전반에 걸쳐 AI가 '운영'의 의미를 근본적으로 바꾸고 있다. 기존 운영 지휘 센터(command center)가 수동적 모니터링 허브였다면, AI 기반 지휘 센터는 다음 최적 행동을 제안하고 루틴 업무를 자율 실행하며 인간의 판단이 필요할 때만 에스컬레이션하는 **능동적 운영 파트너**로 진화하고 있다.

실제 파일럿에서 AI 시스템은 이미 **월말 결산 절차**(계정 조정, 불일치 감지, 보고서 초안 생성)와 **공급업체 리스크 점검**(계약 준수 모니터링, 공급업체 추천)을 처리하고 있다. 이는 단순 규칙 기반 자동화가 아닌 다단계 추론과 데이터 통합이 필요한 작업들이다.

핵심 개념인 **인간-AI 공동 조종(human-AI co-steering)**: AI가 대량의 루틴 의사결정을 기계 속도로 처리하고, 인간은 예외 상황·전략적 판단·AI 시스템 감독에 집중한다. Capgemini CTInO Manuel Sevilla: "운영은 더 이상 한 번 최적화하고 유지하는 정적 시스템이 아니다. AI가 프로세스에 내장되고 인간이 함께 조종하는 지능형·적응형 코어로 진화하고 있다."

보고서의 핵심 주장: 지능형 운영의 진짜 가치는 비용 절감을 넘어 **새로운 가치 스트림 창출**과 운영을 **성장 엔진으로 전환**하는 것이다.

---

### 트렌드 3: Cloud 3.0 — 클라우드의 모든 형태

클라우드 컴퓨팅이 세 번째 주요 진화 단계에 진입하고 있다. 1단계 이전(migration), 2단계 최적화에 이어 **Cloud 3.0**은 클라우드가 AI와 AI 운영 애플리케이션의 **실행 백본**이 되는 단계다.

수치로 본 규모: **퍼블릭 클라우드 지출 2025년 $7,230억 → 2029년 $1.47조로 거의 두 배 성장** 전망. 생성형 AI만으로도 **2020년대 말까지 전체 클라우드 지출의 10~15% 차지** 예상.

AI(특히 에이전틱 AI)의 인프라 요구사항이 단일 퍼블릭 클라우드 아키텍처의 한계를 드러낸다: 독점 데이터 파인튜닝, 데이터 민감도·거주지 통제, 저지연 엣지 추론, 분산 멀티에이전트 시스템 운영. 이 모든 요구를 단일 하이퍼스케일러가 동시에 충족하는 것은 불가능하다.

두 가지 구조적 압력: (1) 대규모 클라우드 장애가 드러낸 **단일 공급업체 의존 리스크**, (2) **지정학적 긴장 및 데이터 주권 요구사항**.

2026년 세 가지 신호:
- **AI 최적화 하이브리드 아키텍처**: 프라이빗 클라우드에서 모델 파인튜닝, 엣지에서 추론 실행
- **멀티클라우드 이식성 프레임워크**: 복수 클라우드에서 핵심 앱 운영 — 비용이 아닌 회복력과 주권이 목적
- **소버린 클라우드 리전·오버레이**: 금융·공공·의료 선도 — 하이퍼스케일러 규모 + 관할권 통제의 결합

Capgemini CTO Eric Fradet: "클라우드는 AI 워크로드 실행과 에이전틱 시스템 오케스트레이션에 필요한 지능형 패브릭을 제공해야 하는 새로운 단계에 진입했다. 미래 클라우드는 멀티클라우드, 하이브리드, 엣지 환경이 단일 연속체로 작동하는 본질적으로 다면적인 형태다."

Cloud 3.0의 차별화 역량: 단일 최고 플랫폼 선택이 아닌 **상호운용성·이식성·지능형 워크로드 배치의 마스터링**.

---

### 트렌드 4: 기술 주권의 국경 없는 역설

기술 주권이 전략 의제의 최상단으로 복귀했다 — COVID-19 이후 볼 수 없었던 수준으로. 핵심 공급망 긴장, 데이터·클라우드 의존성 재검토, AI 인프라 통제 우려가 주권을 이사회급 과제로 부상시켰다.

**역설**: 세계는 본질적으로 국경 없는 기술 위에 구축되어 있는데, 전략적 명령은 그 기술에 대한 통제를 강화하라는 것이다. 반도체·클라우드·오픈소스 프레임워크·프론티어 AI 모델에 의존하는 현실에서 완전한 기술 자율성은 환상이다.

**새로운 정의**: 주권 = 고립(isolation)이 아닌 **회복력 있는 상호의존(resilient interdependence)**. 글로벌 기술 생태계에서 이탈하는 것이 아니라, 제재·장애·지정학적 충격에 의해 핵심 운영이 중단되지 않도록 보장하는 것.

대응: 완전한 디커플링이 아닌 **의존도 리스크를 줄이는 대안 마련**. 모든 주요 하이퍼스케일러가 2026년 소버린·규제 클라우드 오퍼링 출시 완료 → **설계로서의 주권(sovereignty-by-design)** 표준화 진행 중.

세 가지 신호:
1. **소버린 클라우드·데이터 통제 아키텍처**: 민감한 워크로드를 관할권 통제 클라우드 영역으로 이동
2. **소버린 AI 생태계**: 국가·산업별 기반 모델, 국가 훈련 데이터셋 개발 → 고위험 워크로드(의료·금융·국방)의 외국 블랙박스 모델 탈피
3. **국내 컴퓨트·공급망 회복력 프로그램**: 반도체 팹, GPU 클러스터, 하드웨어 공급업체 다변화

### 2030년 이후를 위한 신호

가장 중대한 기술 변화는 디지털 인터페이스가 아닌 **원자·분자 수준에서 물리 세계를 컴퓨팅하고 엔지니어링하는 능력의 발전**에서 나올 것이다. HPC·AI·자동화 실험실이 소재 혁신을 경험적 시행착오에서 제1원리 기반 설계로 전환시키고 있다.

**신호 1 — 양자 거동에 의해 정의되는 소재**: 소재의 성능·내구성·신뢰성이 고전 공학이 포착하기 어려운 양자 규모 효과에 의해 결정된다. HPC+AI+양자 기법의 조합이 원자 수준에서 소재 거동을 시뮬레이션·예측 가능하게 한다. 결과: 차세대 배터리·촉매·전자 소재·초전도체의 의도적 설계.

**신호 2 — 차세대 생분해성**: 소재가 원자·분자 수준에서 어떻게 분해되는지 모델링 가능해짐. AI·양자 컴퓨팅이 화학적·물리적 분해 경로를 시뮬레이션. 미래 소재는 처음부터 성능·내구성·제어된 수명 종료 동작을 균형 있게 설계 가능 → 포장재·섬유·전자·의료기기 전 산업에 영향.

**신호 3 — 합성 재료 과학**: 소재를 발견하는 것에서 의도적으로 설계하는 것으로의 전환. AI 기반 모델과 자동화 실험실이 방대한 소재 조합을 탐색. 클라우드 도구와 공유 컴퓨팅 인프라가 진입 장벽을 낮춰 소재 혁신이 소수 엘리트 실험실을 넘어 민주화된다.

종합 의미: 다음 기술 진보는 **고급 컴퓨팅·화학·생물학의 수렴**에 의해 주도된다. **물질 자체에 대한 통제가 전략적 역량**이 되는 세계가 오고 있다.

### 마무리

2026년 기술 지형은 AI의 성숙과 소프트웨어 전반 통합, Cloud 3.0으로의 클라우드 진화, 지능형 운영의 부상, 기술 주권의 설계 원칙화라는 네 가지 힘에 의해 형성된다. 이 트렌드들은 개별적이지 않다 — 수렴하여 상호 연결되고 회복력 있는 기술 프레임워크를 향한 공통 궤도를 그린다.

AI 통합의 성숙한 실현, Cloud 3.0 아키텍처 수용, 주권을 설계 원칙으로 내재화하는 것: 이것이 2026년과 그 이후를 위한 경쟁 우위의 기반이다.
