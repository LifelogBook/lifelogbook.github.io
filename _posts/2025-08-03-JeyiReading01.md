# Book Summary
*The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas* is a 2006 historical fiction novel by Irish author John Boyne. Set during World War II, the story is told from the perspective of an innocent nine-year-old German boy, Bruno.

## Setting and Characters

* **Bruno:** The nine-year-old protagonist. He is naive, curious, and largely unaware of the political realities of his time. He misses his home in Berlin and his friends.
* **Shmuel:** A nine-year-old Jewish boy who is a prisoner in the Auschwitz concentration camp. He is thin, sad, and wise beyond his years due to his experiences.
* **Ralf (Father):** Bruno's father, a high-ranking Nazi officer who is promoted to Commandant of Auschwitz. He is a strict, patriotic man dedicated to his duty.
* **Elsa (Mother):** Bruno's mother. She is initially supportive of her husband but becomes increasingly horrified by the reality of his work.
* **Gretel:** Bruno's twelve-year-old sister, whom he calls "a Hopeless Case." She quickly embraces Nazi ideology.
* **The setting:** The story begins in Berlin but quickly moves to "Out-With," Bruno's mispronunciation of Auschwitz, the infamous Nazi concentration camp in German-occupied Poland.

## Plot Summary

The novel opens in Berlin, where nine-year-old Bruno lives a comfortable life with his family. His world is turned upside down when his father, a Nazi officer, is promoted and the family must relocate to the countryside. Bruno hates his new home; it is desolate, cold, and there are no other children to play with.

From his bedroom window, Bruno can see a long fence, and behind it, thousands of people all dressed in what he believes to be "striped pyjamas." He is forbidden from going near the fence, and his questions about the people are met with vague and dismissive answers from his parents. Lonely and bored, Bruno, who fancies himself an explorer, decides to investigate the fence.

During one of his explorations along the fence line, he meets Shmuel, a boy his own age sitting on the other side. Despite the barbed wire that separates them, the two boys strike up a secret friendship. They meet nearly every day, and Bruno brings Shmuel food. Bruno learns that Shmuel is a Jew and that he and his family were forced from their home and brought to the camp. However, Bruno's profound innocence prevents him from understanding the true horror of Shmuel's situation. He cannot comprehend the starvation, forced labor, and brutality that define life inside the camp. To him, it is a strange, sad place, but he doesn't grasp its deadly purpose.

The friendship is tested when Shmuel is brought into Bruno's house to clean glassware, and Bruno denies knowing him and giving him food, leading to Shmuel being beaten. Bruno is later filled with remorse and apologizes.

The novel's climax arrives when Bruno's mother, increasingly distraught by their proximity to the camp, convinces her husband to let her take the children back to Berlin. On the day before his planned departure, Bruno goes to say goodbye to Shmuel, who is distressed because his father has gone missing inside the camp. Wanting to make amends for his earlier betrayal and to have one great adventure with his friend, Bruno agrees to help Shmuel look for his father. Shmuel brings a spare set of "striped pyjamas" and a cap to cover Bruno's shaved head. Bruno digs a hole under the fence and slips into the camp.

Once inside, Bruno is shocked by the grim reality. He sees emaciated, hopeless people and armed guards. Before they can search for long, the boys are swept up with a group of other prisoners and herded into a dark, airtight chamber. Bruno, holding Shmuel's hand, assumes they are just taking shelter from the rain. The novel ends as the door is sealed and the boys die together in a gas chamber.

The final chapter briefly describes the aftermath. Bruno's family searches for him for days. His mother and sister eventually return to Berlin. His father remains at "Out-With," and it is only a year later that he pieces together what happened to his son. He is last seen being taken away by Allied soldiers, "and he didn't really mind what they did to him anymore."

## Themes

* **Innocence and Naivety:** The story is told through the eyes of a child who cannot comprehend the hatred and violence around him. Bruno's mispronunciations ("Out-With" for Auschwitz, "the Fury" for the Führer) highlight his detachment from the adult world.
* **Friendship Across Barriers:** The central theme is the powerful, unconditional friendship between Bruno and Shmuel, which transcends the physical barrier of the fence and the ideological barriers of Nazism and antisemitism.
* **Humanity and Dehumanization:** The novel contrasts the humanity of the two boys' friendship with the systematic dehumanization of the prisoners in the camp, who are reduced to numbers and striped uniforms.
* **Complicity and Blindness:** The story serves as a fable about the dangers of ignorance and turning a blind eye to atrocity. Bruno's family, particularly his father, represents the complicity of ordinary people in horrific events.

## **Part 4: Short Answer Questions**

*Write a sentence or two to answer each question.*

1.  What does Bruno think the people in the camp are wearing? What does this tell you about him?
    ________________________________________________________________
    ________________________________________________________________

2.  Why is Bruno's mother unhappy living at "Out-With"?
    ________________________________________________________________
    ________________________________________________________________


# Essay topics

## The Fable of Innocence: 
The novel is subtitled "A Fable." Discuss how John Boyne uses Bruno's profound innocence to explore the horrors of the Holocaust. How does seeing events through a child's eyes change the reader's perspective?

## Friendship Across Barriers: 
Analyze the friendship between Bruno and Shmuel. What makes their bond so powerful, and how does it challenge the hatred and prejudice that surrounds them? Discuss the significance of the fence, both as a physical and a symbolic barrier.

## Blindness and Complicity: 
Explore the theme of "turning a blind eye." Compare Bruno's naive blindness to the willful blindness of other characters, such as his mother or even his father. Who is more responsible for the tragedy, and why?

## Humanity vs. Dehumanization: 
Contrast the moments of simple humanity (like Bruno sharing food) with the systematic dehumanization of the camp. How does the novel argue that titles, uniforms, and ideology can strip people of their humanity?
