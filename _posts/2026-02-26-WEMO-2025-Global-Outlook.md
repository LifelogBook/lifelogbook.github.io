## Part 1: English Summary

### Report Overview

**Publisher**: Capgemini, in collaboration with Hogan Lovells, Vaasa ETT, and Enerdata
**Editor**: Colette Lewiner
**Edition**: 27th annual edition
**Date**: September 2, 2025 (Paris)
**Pages**: 54
**Central Question**: *"How are AI and sovereignty driving a new energy paradigm in an uncertain world?"*

The **World Energy Markets Outlook (WEMO) 2025** is Capgemini's flagship annual energy report, now in its 27th edition. It provides a comprehensive review of global energy markets and the state of the energy transition, structured around three major themes: the 2024 energy market reality, the three most critical questions for the transition's success, and the geopolitical forces — including AI adoption and sovereignty politics — that are reshaping the global energy landscape. The report concludes with a sobering question: has the energy transition reached a dangerous **tipping point**, at which political retreat, corporate backsliding, and financial disengagement could permanently slow the momentum built over the past decade?

### Part 1A: 2024 Energy Market Outlook

#### Global Energy Consumption and Emissions

The year 2024 saw continued growth in global energy demand. **Global energy consumption rose by 2.2%**, driven primarily by economic expansion in Asia and growing electricity demand worldwide. **Electricity consumption grew even faster, at 4.3%** — a rate significantly above historical averages — reflecting the accelerating electrification of transport, heating, and industrial processes, as well as the rapidly rising electricity needs of data centers supporting AI workloads.

Despite the expansion of renewable energy, 2024 was a year of record-breaking emissions. **Global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reached an all-time high of 53.8 billion metric tons of CO₂ equivalent** — a grim milestone that underscores the gap between the pace of clean energy deployment and the pace of fossil fuel reduction. The world is adding renewables rapidly, but not yet fast enough to offset the demand growth that fossil fuels continue to serve.

#### Electricity Markets

Electricity wholesale prices showed significant geographic variation in 2024. In Europe, average wholesale prices settled at approximately **€74/MWh** — lower than the extreme crisis levels of 2022–2023 but still historically elevated, reflecting ongoing supply tightness, natural gas dependency, and the cost of balancing grids with growing shares of intermittent renewables. In the United States, wholesale electricity prices averaged approximately **$36/MWh**, benefiting from abundant domestic natural gas and a more diversified generation mix.

#### The Surge in Renewables

Solar energy dominated new capacity additions in 2024. **451.9 GW of new solar capacity was installed globally** — a number that reflects China's extraordinary manufacturing and deployment machine, which produces solar panels at approximately **$0.15/watt**, compared to **$0.30–$0.50/watt** in Europe and the United States. Wind additions also continued at a strong pace, though offshore wind faced headwinds particularly in the United States and parts of Europe. **Global clean energy investments reached $2,000 billion**, with China accounting for the largest single share — **$940 billion**, compared to $370 billion for Europe and $315 billion for the United States.

#### Battery Market

The battery market delivered strong results in 2024. **Stationary battery installations, led by China, grew 60% from 2023**, while battery prices fell by **20%** over the same period. The combination of rapid cost reduction and growing deployment is transforming how grids manage the intermittency of solar and wind generation. By **2035**, stationary applications are projected to account for **16% of all batteries deployed globally** — up from a small fraction today — supporting both utility-scale storage and behind-the-meter residential and commercial systems.

#### Natural Gas and Oil Markets

Natural gas markets returned to growth in 2024, with consumption rising approximately **2.8%** globally. Despite ongoing climate commitments, natural gas continued to play a central role in electricity generation, heating, and industrial applications — particularly in Europe, which has been restructuring its supply chains away from Russian gas since 2022.

#### Green Hydrogen: Persistent Challenges

Green hydrogen — produced from renewable electricity via electrolysis — remained one of the most discussed but least delivered components of the energy transition in 2024. Despite significant policy support, the sector continued to face **high production costs**, **electrolyzer supply chain constraints**, **underdeveloped demand**, and **regulatory uncertainty**. The expected cost curve reduction has been slower than forecast, and offtake agreements remain scarce outside of a handful of markets. The gap between the ambition of national hydrogen strategies and the reality of deployed capacity widened further in 2024.

### Part 1B: Three Critical Questions for the Energy Transition

#### Question 1: Will Nuclear Energy Contribute Enough?

A nuclear renaissance is underway — but whether it will be large enough and fast enough to contribute meaningfully to the COP28 goal of **tripling global nuclear capacity by 2050** remains deeply uncertain.

The pathway requires a combination of actions simultaneously: avoiding politically motivated reactor closures (as have occurred in Germany and Japan), reopening viable dormant facilities, extending the operational lives of existing safe reactors (the most cost-effective option available), and constructing a large number of new facilities — including both large-scale **Generation III+ reactors** (1,000 MW and above) and **small modular reactors (SMRs)**.

The geopolitical distribution of nuclear development is highly skewed. China dominates global nuclear expansion, with **61 GW of installed capacity in 2024** and **29 reactors (representing 33 GW) under active construction** — nearly half of all nuclear capacity under construction globally. Russia is the other dominant player, particularly as an exporter of nuclear technology and fuel. Western nations, by contrast, face serious structural challenges: **construction costs for new nuclear plants represent approximately 80% of the lifetime cost** of nuclear generation, construction timelines have lengthened dramatically, supply chains for reactor components have atrophied, and public acceptance remains contested.

For the nuclear renaissance to materialize in the West, a sustained convergence of conditions is required: simplifying and standardizing reactor designs, reinvigorating domestic nuclear supply chains, securing long-term financing with government backing, and maintaining political support across multiple electoral cycles. **SMRs** represent a promising pathway — their modular design could enable factory production, shorter construction timelines, and lower upfront capital requirements — but they have yet to prove cost-effectiveness or demonstrate serial production capability at scale. **Nuclear fusion** remains a transformative but pre-industrial technology that is not expected to contribute to power systems before 2050.

#### Question 2: Will Electrical Grids Adapt?

The electrical grid is the backbone of the energy transition — and it is under unprecedented stress. Decision-makers and the public often underestimate the complexity of the challenge. Grids designed for centralized, dispatchable generation are being asked to absorb rapidly growing shares of intermittent, distributed renewable energy, while simultaneously managing the phased closure of thermal plants that previously provided the system stability, inertia, and frequency regulation that renewables cannot yet replicate.

The challenges are multiple and compounding:
- **Integrating growing intermittent renewables** at a pace that outstrips grid reinforcement
- **Managing thermal plant closures** without creating reliability gaps
- **Adapting to climate change**: more frequent extreme weather events are both increasing demand peaks and threatening grid infrastructure through floods, storms, and wildfires
- **Cybersecurity risks**: as grids become more digitally connected, attack surfaces expand
- **Chronic underfunding**: grid investment has consistently lagged behind the investment in generation
- **Regulatory complexity**: permitting processes for new transmission infrastructure can take a decade or more
- **Public resistance**: overhead power lines face NIMBY opposition in many jurisdictions, slowing critical infrastructure upgrades

The economic cost of grid failure is rising. **Average blackout costs in the United States are projected to increase from $4.90/MWh in 2024–2028 to $50/MWh in 2039–2043** — a tenfold increase driven by growing grid stress as uncontrolled renewable expansion outpaces grid adaptation. The root causes of this trajectory are clear: renewables are being added to grids faster than the grid's capacity to absorb, balance, and distribute them is being upgraded.

Digital technologies — including AI-powered grid management, demand response systems, and advanced forecasting tools — can help manage complexity and improve efficiency. But they are not sufficient on their own. The structural solutions require action on multiple fronts: simplifying and accelerating permitting regulations, revising pricing mechanisms to properly incentivize grid investment, aligning the pace of renewable deployment with grid capacity development, and securing political commitment to the multi-decade, multi-hundred-billion-dollar investment programs that modern grid infrastructure requires.

#### Question 3: What Technologies Will Support the Energy Transition?

There is no single technological silver bullet that will independently meet the 2030 emissions reduction goals. The report is explicit on this point: no single innovation currently available — with the partial exception of nuclear fusion, which remains pre-industrial until 2050 — is capable on its own of bridging the gap between current emissions trajectories and the net-zero pathway. Meeting the 2030 targets will require the **large-scale deployment of a portfolio of mature technologies**, accelerated simultaneously:

- **Enhanced solar panel efficiency**: continued cost reduction and efficiency improvement in photovoltaic technology, building on the extraordinary cost reductions already achieved
- **Advanced electrolyzers**: next-generation electrolysis technology with higher efficiency, lower costs, and longer operational lifetimes to make green hydrogen economically viable
- **High-density batteries with reduced environmental impact**: batteries that store more energy per unit weight and volume, using materials with lower mining footprints and more sustainable supply chains
- **Generation III nuclear reactors**: proven, large-scale nuclear plants with improved safety and standardized designs that can be built more predictably and cost-effectively than earlier generations

Achieving deployment at the required scale demands action from both governments — who must create robust legal and financial frameworks, long-term policy certainty, and streamlined permitting — and the private sector — which must significantly accelerate investment, contingent on clear signals that profitable returns are achievable over investment timeframes.

### Part 1C: AI and GenAI in the Energy Sector

#### Adoption and Market Growth

Artificial intelligence — and generative AI in particular — is emerging as a transformative technology for the energy and utilities sector, though the path to value realization remains challenging. **74% of energy and utility companies have already implemented or are actively exploring AI**, reflecting the sector's recognition of AI's potential for operational improvement, cost reduction, and service quality enhancement.

The market opportunity is substantial. **The GenAI market for utilities is projected to grow from $534 million in 2022 to $9 billion by 2032**, at a compound annual growth rate of **33.1%** — one of the fastest growth trajectories of any technology application in the sector.

#### Where AI Delivers Value

In the near term, the clearest and most straightforward value from AI in energy companies comes from:
- **Administrative functions**: automating document processing, contract management, reporting, and regulatory compliance workflows — areas where AI delivers speed and consistency gains with relatively low risk
- **Customer-facing chatbots and virtual agents**: improving response times, resolution rates, and customer satisfaction in call centers and digital channels
- **Asset integrity management**: AI-powered inspection models that integrate data from drones, satellites, ground-based sensors, and historical maintenance records to detect corrosion, equipment degradation, and failure risks earlier and more accurately than traditional inspection cycles — translating directly into reduced unplanned outages and lower maintenance costs

Beyond these immediate applications, AI has significant potential in grid management and demand forecasting, real-time optimization of renewable generation dispatch, predictive maintenance for large rotating assets such as turbines and generators, and accelerating the design and simulation of new energy infrastructure.

#### The Challenge of ROI

Despite the enthusiasm, delivering measurable return on investment from AI remains difficult. An IBM survey of 2,000 CEOs in Q1 2025 found that **only 25% of AI initiatives had delivered expected ROI** — a sobering number that reflects the difficulty of moving from proof of concept to scaled, operationally embedded deployment. However, the outlook is more optimistic: **85% of leaders expected to see positive ROI from scaled AI investments by 2027**, suggesting that the value will materialize for organizations that successfully navigate the transition from pilot to enterprise-wide implementation.

#### AI's Energy Footprint: The Paradox

AI creates an important paradox for the energy sector. On one hand, AI models and optimization tools can help **reduce CO₂ emissions by 5–10% by 2030** by improving the efficiency of energy systems, industrial processes, and building operations. On the other hand, the massive electricity consumption of the data centers required to train and run large language models and other AI systems is raising serious concerns.

**Microsoft's greenhouse gas emissions increased by 30% since 2020**, largely driven by the electricity consumption of data center expansion to support AI services. The training of frontier AI models and the delivery of GenAI inference at scale requires extraordinary amounts of electricity — and much of that electricity, in many markets, still comes partly from fossil fuel sources. The challenge for the sector is clear: the energy industry must both leverage AI to accelerate the transition and simultaneously address the emissions implications of AI's own rapidly growing energy footprint.

Addressing this paradox requires a combination of approaches: **energy-efficient AI algorithms** that achieve comparable results with less compute, **efficient data center cooling** systems that reduce the power usage effectiveness (PUE) ratio, and a commitment to powering AI infrastructure with **genuinely low-emission electricity sources** — not merely through carbon offsets or renewable energy certificates.

Quantum computing represents an even longer-term consideration: prototype quantum computers already consume significant electricity, and when large-scale fault-tolerant quantum computers become available, their ability to break current cryptographic systems will force a complete overhaul of cybersecurity infrastructure — an overhaul that itself will consume substantial energy and resources.

### Part 1D: Geopolitical Impacts on the Energy Sector

#### Escalating Tensions Throughout 2024 and H1 2025

Throughout 2024 and the first half of 2025, geopolitical tensions escalated across multiple regions, directly impacting energy markets, supply chains, and the pace of the energy transition. Control over energy resources and the raw materials required for clean energy technologies has become an increasingly central driver of geopolitical conflict and competition.

#### The Russia-Ukraine War and European Energy Security

The Russia-Ukraine war continued to reshape European energy markets. Russia's motivations include securing rare earth deposits, controlling gas transit pipelines, and maintaining access to oil fields in the Crimean region. The **EU imposed new sanctions on Russian gas** — a continuation of the gradual but painful European effort to reduce its long-standing dependence on Russian energy supplies. In 2025, the United States and Ukraine signed a strategic energy minerals agreement, granting the US access to Ukraine's substantial reserves of lithium, graphite (approximately 20% of global reserves), and uranium.

#### The 12-Day Israel-Iran War

One of the most significant energy market events of H1 2025 was the **12-day war between Israel and Iran**, which aimed at preventing Iran's development of nuclear weapons capability. The conflict highlighted the extreme vulnerability of global energy markets to disruption in the Middle East. The **Strait of Hormuz** — the narrow waterway through which approximately **20% of the world's oil and 20% of global LNG** passes — was at risk of closure during the conflict.

The immediate price impact was sharp: **Brent crude oil rose from approximately $69/barrel before the conflict to $81/barrel** at its peak. However, the market reaction proved temporary: after the 12-day war ended, **Brent crude dropped back to approximately $67/barrel** — actually below the pre-war level — as markets concluded the disruption was contained. The episode nonetheless served as a stark reminder of the structural vulnerability that persists as long as the world remains dependent on fossil fuels transiting geopolitically exposed chokepoints.

Separately, **Houthi attacks in the Red Sea disrupted approximately 12% of global seaborne oil trade**, with shipping rates rising **200–400%** as tankers were forced to reroute around Africa rather than through the Suez Canal. LNG tankers similarly avoided the Red Sea, adding weeks to delivery times and billions in shipping costs.

#### China's Dominance in Green Technology

China's position as the global leader in clean energy manufacturing represents one of the most consequential geopolitical dynamics shaping the energy transition. China has built dominant market positions across every critical technology:

- **Solar panels**: approximately **80% of global production capacity**
- **Wind turbines**: approximately **65% of global production capacity**
- **Battery cells**: more than **80% of global production capacity**
- **Electrolyzers**: approximately **60% of global manufacturing capacity**
- **Critical minerals**: **76% of cobalt**, **90% of graphite processing**, **90% of rare earth elements (REE)** market share
- **Green energy investments**: **$940 billion in 2024** — more than 2.5 times Europe's $370 billion and nearly three times the US's $315 billion

China's cost advantages are dramatic. A **Chinese solar panel costs approximately $0.15/watt** — compared to **$0.30–$0.50/watt** for panels produced in Europe or the United States. This cost differential makes unsubsidized domestic production economically unviable in Western markets without protective tariffs.

In July 2025, **China imposed export restrictions on critical EV battery technologies and lithium supply** — a move widely interpreted as a geopolitical countermeasure in the context of escalating trade tensions with the United States. The restrictions create significant supply chain vulnerabilities for Western EV manufacturers and battery producers.

#### The US Response: Tariffs and Industrial Policy

The United States has responded to China's green technology dominance with **high protective tariffs**: **100% on Chinese-made EVs, 50% on solar cells, and 25% on lithium-ion batteries** (as of June 2025). These tariffs aim to create space for domestic manufacturing to develop — but in the near term, they significantly increase the cost of clean energy deployment for US consumers and businesses.

Chinese companies have responded by establishing manufacturing plants in Southeast Asia to circumvent the tariffs — exporting products to the US from countries not subject to the same duties. The US Commerce Department responded with a further escalation, announcing in **April 2025 new tariffs of up to 3,521%** targeting companies believed to be using this strategy.

#### Europe's Policy Response and Sovereignty

Europe's response to the geopolitical challenge of clean technology dependency has taken the form of sovereignty-focused industrial policy. The EU has introduced **non-tariff criteria for renewable energy procurement auctions** (effective December 2025) — effectively creating domestic content requirements that favor European manufacturers in public procurement. The EU has also reaffirmed its **2040 target of reducing GHG emissions by 90%** relative to 1990 levels, maintained a policy of **technology neutrality** (including nuclear as a low-carbon source), and integrated nuclear and carbon capture into the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS).

#### The New US Energy Policy: Sovereignty Plus Climate Skepticism

The Trump administration's energy policy represents a fundamental departure from US climate commitments. Under the banner of **"American energy dominance"**, the administration has:

- **Withdrawn from the Paris Climate Agreement**
- **Halted federal offshore wind leasing** via executive order on January 20, 2025, indefinitely pausing offshore wind lease sales in US federal waters — putting approximately **32 GW of planned offshore wind capacity at risk**
- **Paused Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) and Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) funding** for renewable energy projects
- Signed the **One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA)** on July 4, 2025, which significantly scales back clean energy tax incentives
- Proposed a **2026 budget that slashes more than $15 billion** from renewable energy and carbon capture funding, while also eliminating **$6 billion in EV charging infrastructure** support and aiming to eliminate the EV tax credit (saving an estimated $2.5 billion over the decade)

The administration simultaneously supports nuclear energy — both SMRs and large conventional plants — and prioritizes fossil fuel production, particularly natural gas. US LNG exports are projected to **nearly double from 88.4 MTPA in 2024 to approximately 100 MTPA by 2031**, with the Commonwealth LNG project in Louisiana expected to add 9.5 MTPA of new capacity as early as 2026.

In **July 2025**, the US and EU reached a tariff deal: **15% tariffs on most EU exports to the United States**, while US exports to the EU face **zero tariffs**. As part of the broader deal, the EU committed to **purchase $750 billion of American energy over three years** (~$250 billion annually), cementing US LNG as a long-term pillar of European energy security.

#### Impact on European Energy Companies

US policy reversals have directly impacted major European energy companies with US offshore wind investments:
- **EDF**: took a **$940 million write-off** on its Atlantic Shores project
- **Engie**: delayed the Southcoast Wind project (Massachusetts/Rhode Island) from 2024 to 2029
- **Equinor**: halted its Empire Wind I project
- **RWE**: halted all US offshore wind activities
- **Ørsted** and others similarly affected across their US portfolios

### Part 1E: Has the Energy Transition Reached a Tipping Point?

Perhaps the most sobering section of the WEMO 2025 report is its analysis of whether the energy transition has reached a dangerous tipping point — a moment at which the cumulative effect of corporate backsliding, political retreat, and financial disengagement could permanently compromise the trajectory toward net zero.

#### Financial Institutions Scaling Back Climate Commitments

The retreat of major financial institutions from climate commitments has been one of the most consequential developments of 2024–2025. Prompted in part by US executive orders promoting coal production — which put pressure on banks to demonstrate they were not restricting access to finance for US fossil fuel industries — **six prominent banks**, including **JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup**, **withdrew from the Net-Zero Banking Alliance** in early 2025. These six institutions together manage **more than $14.29 trillion in assets**, representing approximately **20% of the total assets held by all Net-Zero Banking Alliance members**. Their departure weakens the alliance's credibility and reduces the financial system's organized commitment to decarbonizing lending portfolios.

At the same time, the broader ESG landscape is under pressure. The US administration has explicitly claimed that ESG practices impede economic growth, major proxy advisory firm **Glass Lewis scrapped its ESG requirements**, and international companies working with the US administration have shifted away from their ESG commitments. Despite this, a **BDO survey in 2024 found that 53% of CFOs had embedded ESG into their company's core strategy** — up from 33% a year earlier — with European companies significantly more committed than their American counterparts.

#### Oil and Gas Majors Reducing Climate Ambitions

The retreat is not limited to financial institutions. Several major international oil and gas companies have significantly reduced their climate commitments:

**BP** abandoned its 2030 target to cut oil and gas production by 40% and revised its emissions reduction target downward from **35–40% to 20–30% by 2030**. In July 2025, BP agreed to **sell its entire US onshore wind portfolio** — comprising 10 assets across 7 states with 1.3 GW of combined capacity — to LS Power. Shell made similar retreats from low-carbon commitments.

**TotalEnergies** represents a notable exception: the company has maintained its climate commitments, **allocated €5 billion (27% of total capital expenditure) to renewables in 2024**, and maintained its target of reaching 100 GW of renewable capacity by 2030. Even TotalEnergies, however, paused its offshore wind activities in New York amid the political uncertainties created by US policy.

The combined GHG emissions of the top five international oil companies — **ExxonMobil, Chevron, Shell, TotalEnergies, and BP** — total approximately **2.2 GtCO₂**, representing **5.1% of global fossil fuel CO₂** emissions.

#### European Political Changes Signaling Slowdown

Political changes within Europe are also creating headwinds:

- **Poland**: newly elected President Nawrocki has made "energy sovereignty" — focused on coal, US LNG imports, and bilateral security alliances rather than EU climate mandates — a central policy priority
- **Germany**: the new conservative government has committed to building **20 GW of gas-fired power plants by 2030**, prioritizing energy security over decarbonization pace
- **Hungary**: continues to rely heavily on Russian gas for approximately 75% of its consumption and remains in active negotiations with Gazprom, maintaining a structural dependency that creates tensions with EU energy policy

#### EU Defense Spending vs. Climate Funding

One of the most consequential structural tensions facing Europe is the competition between rapidly increasing defense budgets and the financing requirements of the climate transition. The Trump administration's reduction of US NATO commitments has prompted EU member states to commit to increasing defense spending significantly — targeting **3.5% of GDP** in many cases.

With the EU carrying **an average debt-to-GDP ratio of 81%** and an average deficit of **3.2% of GDP in 2024**, the fiscal space for new large-scale public investment is severely constrained. This creates a genuine risk that the **€580 billion allocated in the EU's 2021–2027 budget for climate neutrality** could face reallocation pressure. It also jeopardizes the commitments made at **COP29 to provide $300 billion in annual climate finance to developing nations** — countries that are among the most vulnerable to climate change and the least able to self-fund the transition.

#### The Question of Public Support and Affordability

The energy transition's long-term viability ultimately depends on public support — and that support is increasingly fragile in some markets. **German households are paying approximately €0.40/kWh in 2025** — more than twice the US average of $0.18/kWh — as the costs of the Energiewende (Germany's energy transition) flow through to electricity bills. Germany's total energy transition investment stands at **€696 billion (€387 billion in investments plus €310 billion in subsidies)**, and the costs continue to grow. Achieving a zero-carbon global economy by 2050 would require **$3.5–$4.5 trillion in annual investment globally** — a scale of mobilization that has no historical precedent.

Affordability concerns, combined with NIMBY opposition to wind turbines and power lines, are reducing public support for renewable energy expansion in parts of Europe and North America. In France, a moratorium bill on renewable energy expansion passed its first reading in Parliament before ultimately being rejected in June 2025 — a sign of growing political resistance even in one of Europe's most traditionally pro-nuclear, climate-forward countries.

### Conclusion

The WEMO 2025 report closes with a stark observation: **there is an urgent need to accelerate adaptation measures to address the impact of climate change, while also improving access to electricity — a vital resource — for a greater number of people on Earth.** Editor Colette Lewiner's final message is not defeatist, but it is unflinchingly honest about the scale of the challenge.

The 2024 data shows that the energy transition is progressing — renewables are growing, batteries are getting cheaper, nuclear is experiencing a modest renaissance, and AI is beginning to transform operational efficiency. But fossil fuels still account for **80% of global primary energy consumption**, GHG emissions hit a **record 53.8 GtCO₂e**, and the political, financial, and corporate momentum behind decarbonization is weakening in some of the world's most consequential economies.

Sovereignty politics — from the US prioritizing fossil fuels to Europe building clean technology supply chain independence to China cementing its green manufacturing dominance — are increasing costs, fragmenting markets, and creating unpredictability that slows long-term capital investment. AI is transforming energy operations but also adding to electricity demand. Grid infrastructure is lagging behind renewable deployment. Nuclear's contribution remains deeply uncertain.

The tipping point question remains open. Whether the transition accelerates or stalls will depend not on technology — the solutions exist — but on the political will to deploy them at the speed and scale the climate requires.

### 에너지 전환을 위한 3대 핵심 질문

**Q1. 핵에너지가 충분히 기여할 것인가?**

COP28 목표 — **2050년까지 핵 용량 3배 확대** — 달성을 위해서는: 정치적 이유의 원전 폐쇄 방지, 기존 원전 수명 연장(가장 비용 효율적인 방법), 대형 신규 원전 건설(1,000 MW 이상), SMR 상용화가 동시에 필요.

중국: 2024년 **61 GW 설치**, **29기(33 GW) 건설 중** — 전 세계 신규 핵 건설의 거의 절반. 서방: 건설비가 핵발전 총비용의 **80%**, 공기 지연, 공급망 위축. SMR은 잠재력은 있으나 대량 생산과 비용 효과성 검증이 과제. 핵융합: 2050년까지 산업 전단계 기술.

**Q2. 전력망이 적응할 수 있는가?**

전력망은 에너지 전환의 근간이지만 전례 없는 스트레스를 받고 있다. 과제: 간헐적 재생에너지 통합, 열발전소 폐쇄 관리, 기후변화 적응(홍수·폭풍·산불), 사이버보안, 만성적 과소 투자, 복잡한 규제, 주민 반대.

정전 비용: **2024-2028년 $4.90/MWh → 2039-2043년 $50/MWh**으로 10배 상승 예상. 원인: 통제되지 않는 재생에너지 증가 + 전력망 부적응. AI 기술이 도움이 되지만 그것만으로는 불충분 — 규제 간소화, 요금체계 개편, 재생에너지와 전력망 용량의 속도 맞춤 필요.

**Q3. 어떤 기술이 전환을 지원할 것인가?**

2030년 목표 달성에 단일 기술 특효약은 없다. **성숙한 기술들의 대규모 동시 배포**가 필수: 향상된 태양광 효율, 차세대 전해조, 고밀도 저환경충격 배터리, Gen III 핵 원자로. 정부: 안정적 법·재정 프레임워크 제공. 민간: 수익성 확보 시 대규모 투자 확대.

### 마무리

보고서 편집장 Colette Lewiner의 마지막 메시지: *"기후변화의 영향에 대응하는 적응 조치를 가속화하는 동시에, 지구상 더 많은 사람들이 핵심 자원인 전력에 접근할 수 있도록 개선하는 일이 시급하다."*

2024년 재생에너지는 역사적 속도로 성장했지만, 화석연료는 여전히 1차 에너지의 80%를 점유하고 GHG 배출량은 신기록을 경신했다. 주권 정치는 비용을 높이고 시장을 분열시키며 투자 예측 가능성을 낮추고 있다. 기술 솔루션은 존재한다 — 문제는 필요한 속도와 규모로 실행할 정치적 의지다.
