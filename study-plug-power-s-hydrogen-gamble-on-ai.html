  { start: 366.4, end: 372.9, text: "Virginia too. The grid is physically and regularly capped full stop. So if I\'m a hyperscaler and I" },

  { start: 412.7, end: 417.7, text: "in just the next four years. That is the prize. That is why Wall Street is still watching plug power" },
  { start: 417.7, end: 422.9, text: "despite the, well, the roller coaster stock price. Absolutely. But let\'s get technical for a second." },
  { start: 422.9, end: 427.8, text: "I want to understand the magic box. I know what a diesel generator is. It\'s a loud engine," },
  { start: 427.8, end: 435.0, text: "it smokes, it smells. I know what a battery is. What exactly is a hydrogen fuel cell? How does it" },

  { start: 440.6, end: 445.5, text: "to it. The simplest way to think about it is like a battery that never runs out of charge as long" },
  { start: 445.5, end: 451.4, text: "as you keep feeding it fuel. But unlike a diesel generator, there is zero combustion. You aren\'t" },
  { start: 451.4, end: 457.3, text: "exploding fuel to move a piston. There\'s no fire. So no fire, very little noise, no smoke. Exactly." },
  { start: 457.3, end: 462.9, text: "It\'s an electrochemical reaction. You take hydrogen H2. You introduce it to oxygen O2 from the air." },
  { start: 462.9, end: 467.6, text: "You force them through a special membrane. Now the hydrogen wants to bond with the oxygen to" },
  { start: 467.6, end: 472.9, text: "become water. That\'s just the natural reaction. But the membrane forces the electrons to take a" },
  { start: 472.9, end: 477.2, text: "little detour. And that detour is the electricity. That detour is the electrical current. That\'s your" },
  { start: 477.2, end: 483.4, text: "power. So the inputs are just hydrogen and regular air and the output. The output is electricity," },
  { start: 483.4, end: 489.5, text: "pure water and some heat. That\'s it. Nothing else. Okay. So it\'s clean. That\'s a huge selling point." },
  { start: 489.5, end: 493.2, text: "But as I was reading through the competitive landscape, it seems like not all fuel cells are" },
  { start: 493.2, end: 498.9, text: "created equal. We have these two main tribes here. There\'s the PEM tribe and there\'s the SOFC" },
  { start: 498.9, end: 503.5, text: "tribe. Yes. I\'ll need to distinguish these because it really explains why plug power is" },
  { start: 503.5, end: 508.2, text: "winning some contracts and frankly losing others. This is probably the most important technical" },
  { start: 508.2, end: 513.9, text: "distinction for anyone following this sector. It\'s critical. Plug power specialty is PEM. That" },
  { start: 513.9, end: 519.4, text: "stands for proton exchange membrane. PEM. And the best way to think about PEM is to imagine a" },
  { start: 519.4, end: 525.4, text: "sprinter. It runs at a relatively low temperature, maybe 80 degrees Celsius. Because it\'s cool," },
  { start: 525.4, end: 531.2, text: "it can start up in minutes. It is incredibly agile. It can ramp power up and down almost instantly." },
  { start: 531.2, end: 535.1, text: "Which seems really important for computers, right? Because computing loads aren\'t these flat" },
  { start: 535.1, end: 541.6, text: "steady lines. Exactly. AI training workloads are incredibly spiky. When a neural network is training," },
  { start: 541.6, end: 548.0, text: "the power demand just spikes through the roof. When it\'s idle, it drops to almost nothing. A PEM" },
  { start: 548.1, end: 553.0, text: "fuel cell can follow that curve perfectly. It\'s great for what\'s called following the load." },
  { start: 553.0, end: 559.5, text: "Okay. So plug is the sprinter agile, quick to react. Who\'s the other guy? The other technology is" },
  { start: 559.5, end: 565.0, text: "SOFC. That\'s solid oxide fuel cell. SOFC. This is the technology used by plug\'s main rival," },
  { start: 565.0, end: 572.2, text: "bloom energy. And if PEM is the sprinter, SOFC is the marathon runner. It runs hot. Extremely hot," },
  { start: 572.2, end: 576.7, text: "like 800 degrees Celsius. Wow. Okay. Because it\'s so hot, you can\'t just turn it off and on" },
  { start: 576.7, end: 581.7, text: "whatever you want. If you turn it off, it takes hours or even days to cool down and then heat" },
  { start: 581.7, end: 586.3, text: "back up again without cracking the ceramic plates inside. So bloom\'s tech is designed to turn on and" },
  { start: 586.3, end: 592.8, text: "just stay on. Correct. It is base load power. It\'s incredibly efficient if all you want is a flat," },
  { start: 592.8, end: 599.7, text: "continuous line of electricity, 247. But it is not agile at all. So in this data center war," },
  { start: 599.7, end: 604.3, text: "you have this really interesting dynamic. Do you want the sprinter, which is plugged that can handle" },
  { start: 604.3, end: 609.3, text: "the spikes? Or do you want the marathon runner bloom that gives you steady, efficient power?" },
  { start: 609.3, end: 613.8, text: "And historically, plug used the sprinter tech for forklifts. And I know people, they roll the" },
  { start: 613.8, end: 617.6, text: "rise at the forklift thing. They say, oh, it\'s just a warehouse company. But there\'s a real logic" },
  { start: 617.6, end: 623.1, text: "there, isn\'t there? There\'s a massive logic to it. Think about a forklift for a second. It stops," },
  { start: 623.1, end: 629.4, text: "it starts, it looks a really heavy load, then it sits idle. It has a completely chaotic power profile." },
  { start: 629.4, end: 635.1, text: "It\'s the definition of a spiky low. It is exactly what PEM technology is designed for. And the" },
  { start: 635.1, end: 641.2, text: "key is plug is deployed over 72,000 of these systems in the real world. They\'ve fueled them" },
  { start: 641.2, end: 647.3, text: "millions and millions of times. So while the forklift company label isn\'t sexy, it provided them" },
  { start: 647.3, end: 652.7, text: "with a mountain of real world data on how these stacks perform under constant stress. They are" },
  { start: 652.7, end: 657.1, text: "guessing about reliability. So they have the reliability data. They\'ve proven it works at a small" },
  { start: 657.1, end: 661.7, text: "scale. But now they\'re trying to scale that up from what a five kilowatt forklift to a 50" },
  { start: 661.7, end: 666.5, text: "megawatt data center. That is a massive job. A huge leap. And this brings us to the deal that really" },
  { start: 666.5, end: 670.6, text: "changed the narrative. Because for a long time, plug was just burning cash promising this hydrogen" },
  { start: 670.6, end: 677.3, text: "future that always felt very far away. But then in November of 2025, they dropped a bombshell." },
  { start: 677.3, end: 681.8, text: "Yes, the asset monetization deal. This was very clever move. Here\'s where it gets really interesting" },
  { start: 681.8, end: 688.2, text: "for me. They signed a letter of intent in L.O.I. with a major U.S. data center developer. They" },
  { start: 688.2, end: 693.3, text: "didn\'t name them, which of course led to a ton of speculation. But the deal wasn\'t just about" },
  { start: 693.3, end: 698.3, text: "selling hardware, which is what I expected. Plug was selling something called electricity rights." },
  { start: 699.0, end: 705.4, text: "What is that? This was a fascinating strategic play. Years and years ago, plug power" },
  { start: 706.2, end: 712.4, text: "and its grand vision secured rights to draw power from the grid and use infrastructure in places" },
  { start: 712.4, end: 718.1, text: "like New York State. The original intent was to use that grid power to build their own hydrogen" },
  { start: 718.1, end: 722.6, text: "plants. Okay, that makes sense. But as the years went by and the grid by more and more congested," },
  { start: 722.6, end: 727.4, text: "those rights themselves became incredibly valuable assets. It\'s like buying a plot of land in" },
